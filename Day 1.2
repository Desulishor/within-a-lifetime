    "I've awoke in my bedroom."
    "Was that really just a dream?"
    "Again it's cold but I don't have time to deal with it today, I need to think about what happened last night."
    "Actually was it last night? The voice told me I could change what happened..."
    "I check my clock."
    "It's March 3rd, same as yesterday... or today?"
    "So this means I've been sent back to the beginning of today."
    "Or did I really just imagine all of those things happening last night?"
    "Hold on, how is this happening?"
    "I recall a voice last night, telling me I could change what had happened."
    "I'm not really sure what happened after that."
    
    "I'm by no means a sci-fi fan but I do know a little about time travel."
    "Although as far as I knew all of that was fiction."
    "There are several theories regarding time travel and how it works."
    "Of course they might all be wrong but I recall one of them about breaking off from a time line and creating a new one."
    "Which means in some parallel universe Kunikada is still dead."
    "I push this to the back of my mind, while it is unsettling I have no evidence to think it's true."
    "So all I have to go off is what that voice said... I can save Kunikada, maybe that's the answer to this."

    "But how will I do it, how can I save Kunikada?"
    "I don't think it's wise to put her anywhere near the pathway home, maybe if I can get her away from there she'll be safe."
    "I'm sure I'll figure out something today."
    "I quickly get my things and wait for Maeko to come to where she was yesterday."
    "I don't think it's safe to tell Maeko about me coming from a different time, and she probably wouldn't believe me anyway so I'll try to get her to help without mentioning it."
    "And in just a few minutes Maeko does arrive at the same time as before, confirming this truly is a repeat of today."
    "Or maybe I have oddly accurate dreams?"
    "No that can't be it, the chances of me dreaming Maeko being here... she's never come here before school while I'm walking before."

    "But do I do the same as I did yesterday?"

    "There are quite a few options aren't there? I can't be sure which is the best one without testing if it suceeds."
    "The real problem is there's no telling if time travel is still a possibility if I fail."
    "So far I have three ideas."
    "I could wait for Kunikada outside of the school gate to try to convince her to not go to school today. I'd tell her to turn back and go home immediately until tomorrow."
    "She might not listen to me though, considering I'm a stranger."
    "I could ask Maeko if we could stay at her place, but ever since her parents died I haven't be able to stay at her house, she had to move to her aunt and uncles place. Luckily it was in the same city so she didn't move too far."
    "So that might not work either."
    "Or I could wait to see if any other ideas pop up as the day plays out."

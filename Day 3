#Planner for stuff that needs to be written in more depth
#_________________________________________________________
#Meet with Hagami and Mana again, they explain the concept of their club, the Paranormal Investigations Club.
#Choice | Wow, That's amazing | Ehhh, I'm not quite following... |
#Have some dumb investigation of a mystery going on in the school
#Be dragged along and end up solving it, turns out not to be supernatural at all

#Have encounter with Natsumi about joining the baseball club
#They need more member to be formally recognised as a club
#Ask MC to join
#Choice | Join the club | Help them find someone else, end up progressing through their route instead |
#Later go with them to ask Kunikada to join the club, (partially to find out more about her, but mostly to get enough members to make a club.)
label Day3:

    "Beep Beep"
    "I've never been so relieved to hear the sound of an alarm clock in my entire life."
    "Last night I actually remembered to set it."
    "Though when I look around the room I notice Kenta is already up."
    "Whatever he does in the mornings still remains a mystery to me."
    a"Good morning"
    "I half yawn, half say my greeting."
    k"You're up early today."

    "This is the earliest I've made it to school."
    "Kenta and I walked to school but we neither of us cared much to start up any conversation."
    "As I enter the classroom I notice Haruki too, thinking back to yesterday afternoon's practice."
    "But she doesn't bring anything up about it, maybe she didn't see me watching."
    "The morning classes pass by quickly and I find myself yet again wondering where I should go for lunch."
    "Well I got sidetracked yesterday, but originally I had planned to go sit with Hagami and Mana..."
    "It's not too bad of an option, and besides, it's not like I have that many to choose from."

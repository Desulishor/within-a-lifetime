#Planner for stuff that needs to be written in more depth
#_________________________________________________________
#Meet with Hagami and Mana again, they explain the concept of their club, the Paranormal Investigations Club.
#Choice | Wow, That's amazing | Ehhh, I'm not quite following... |
#Have some dumb investigation of a mystery going on in the school
#Be dragged along and end up solving it, turns out not to be supernatural at all

#Have encounter with Natsumi about joining the baseball club
#They need more member to be formally recognised as a club
#Ask MC to join
#Choice | Join the club | Help them find someone else, end up progressing through their route instead |
#Later go with them to ask Kunikada to join the club, (partially to find out more about her, but mostly to get enough members to make a club.)

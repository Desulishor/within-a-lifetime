    "The light is blinding."
    "I struggle to open my eyes, and end up squinting instead."
    "...Hmm"
    "Thump!"
    "Something hit me, right in the head."
    "Thump--"
    "...Come on, I just got here... I don't want to go to school yet..."
    "--Thump"
    "I spent all of last night moving all of my stuff to this place."
    "Thump--"
    "Urghh, it doesn't seem like it cares whether or not I deserve more sleep..."
    "Thump--thump"
    "I can't be late on my first day though... what a pain."
    "Guess I have no choice."
    "Thump, thump, THUMP!"
    a"Ow ow oowwww Hey knock it off already!"
    
    "I open my eyes completely now finding myself in an unfamiliar room, with a throbbing forehead."
    "I have to remind myself where I am, that this is my new home."
    "As of today I officially live here at this dormitory."
    "----a fist comes rushing toward my head without warning."
    "I instinctively lift up my arm to block it."
    "In my sleepy daze I manage to deflect it, instead of hitting my face, the fist lands on my pilow."
    a"Hey come on, I'm up---I'm up you see! All awake now!"
    k"Hmphh, so you are."
    "I look up at the tall guy looming over my bed."
    "He's already dressed in my school's uniform."
    "It's hard for me to remember when my heads all beaten up but I'm pretty sure this guy is my roommate, his name was Kenta I think."
    "I can only hope he isn't like this every morning."
    k"Come on then, we don't have much time."
    k"You needed a wake-up call so I provided it, considering that it's your first day."
    k"I wouldn't mind much if you missed out though, you can always have your first day tomorrow, or the next day, or the next."
    k"But I still wouldn't leave it too long, at that rate you'd never finish high school."
    "I'm not entirely following this guy, I'm not sure if he's being serious or not but I don't think it's safe to ask."
    "I search the room for my clothes, I don't have time for a shower or breakfast so getting my clothes is my first priority."
    "My suitcase is to the side of the clothes draw, last night I didn't get enough time to finish unpacking everything so my uniform should be in here somewh--"
    "--All of my clothes are gone."
    a"Hey you don't happen to know what happened to my clothes do you?"
    "Seemingly focused on something else Kenta just stares off into the distance as I ask him my question."
    a"Hey Kenta, you alright?"
    k"Oh you were talking to me?"
    "Huh, there's no one else in the room... oh well."
    a"Yeah do you know where my clothes are?"
    k"Oh those things, yes I do know what happened to those. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and saw your clothes lying about next to the draws so I figured I should sort them out, it got to me you know?"
    a"Ok so where are they?"
    k"I organised them."
    "I check my draws, they're not there."
    a"Where?"
    k"Oh they're not over there, they're in my draws. I had to colour code them together or else there wouldn't be enough space."
    a"Huh?"
    k"I said they're in my draws, I had to colour code them together or else there wouldn't be enough space."
    a"No, no I got that part."
    a"But why did you mix my clothes with yours?"
    k"Like I said, there wouldn't be enough space."
    a"But I have an entire side over here, completely empty."
    k"Oh sorry, I forgot you didn't know already."
    k"Allow me to explain, before you got here I was alone in this room."
    k"And that space over there is for my collections, I've got some pretty cool stuff you know?"
    k"I had to make some sacrifices by making some room in the clothes draws, and I even gave up a collection draw for your stuff."
    k"Don't worry, I understand how much space one man can need for his things."
    "I quickly pull open the other 3 draws on my side, they're full of displays, fit with individual coins in each section."
    "This guy has to be joking right?"
    "Collecting coins has been a dead hobby for decades."
    "And even back then it was lame."
    k"You seem to have taken a interest to the 1956 set, a very keen eye you have there."
    k"I can tell you a bit about those if you like, you see the metal compostion of coins in the---"
    a"No stop please Kenta, tell me some other time."
    a"I need my uniform right now or else we'll both be late."
    k"Ah don't worry about finding that, I've got you covered friend."
    "He pulls out my uniform from the draw labelled 'darks'."
    k"Here you go, better be quick, otherwise I'll leave without you."
    "I quickly grab the clothes off Kenta and rush into the bathroom to change as he showed no signs of averting his eyes."
    a"Hey your shirt's inside out, you might want to fix that while I'm changing."
    k"Oh darn, that's the 3rd time this week."
    "I can't imagine what he's done considering it's only Monday today."
    "There's no time to think about that anyway."
    "I take a look at myself in the mirror as I begin to get ready, in a way I'm not just reflecting on my physical self, but also my mental self."
    "Already this morning has been crazy, it's pretty different to my old life...well, at least Kenta is different to anyone I've ever met before."
    "My breath condenses on the mirror pane in front of me, it's incredibly cold this morning."
    "I splash my face with the ice cold water as I inspect the rest of my face."
    "While the cold water is uncomfortable, it does do a great job at waking me up."
    "Luckily my forehead isn't bruised from the beating it took this morning, I don't know what I'd would've done if I had walked into class with a purple forehead."
    "My hair is dishevelled, even after brushing it still doesn't sit right."
    "Well it's not like it's ever done that before."
    "I guess this place doesn't have any heaters, unless Kenta is against them for whatever reason."
    "At this point I wouldn't be surprised."
    "Now I just have to change into these clothes quickly before I freeze to death."
    "After I'm finished I unlock the door and step outside to find Kenta waiting for me patiently, this time with his shirt on the right way."
    k"Alright, let's go."
    a"Sure let me just grab my bag."
    "Being my first day my bag is almost enitirely empty apart from a few empty notebooks and pens."
    "I grab my school sweater from my bag and quickly put it on, relieving myself from the cold."
    a"I'm ready now."
    "Kenta leads the way out into the hallway, it seems we're the last ones to leave judging from the lack of sound around us."
    "Everyone's probably already left by now."
    "Now that I think about it Kenta is actually pretty considerate, waking me up and waiting for me... he even organised my clothes for me--though not in the way I'd exactly wanted."
    "In any case his intentions have been good, I was having second thoughts this morning about having him as a roommate."
    "But maybe we'll become good friends someday."
    
    
    "The mountains ahead practically burst with light as the sun rises behind them."
    "The sight blinded me, I haven't seen the sun rising over mountains for a long time."
    "A warm nostalgic feeling rushes over me."

    "I wipe my eyes and rub the sleep away while my eyes attempt to adjust to the brightness."
    "The fresh air is even colder outside, but it's refreshing to be breath in. It's different to the air I've become accustommed to."
    "Which way to school...? My memory struggles to remember where exactly I should be going."
    "I'm sure it can't be far away considering I live at a dormitory but that doesn't help all that much."
    "I'd ask one of the students there but it they've all already left without me."
    "So all that leaves is Kenta, who is convinently walking right next to me."
    "I have a strange feeling that he might not be leading me to school, but I have no idea where else we could be going."
    "Despite my previous knowledge of this town's geography I have no idea where we are right now."
    "I suppose things change a lot in a year, and I never visted this area before that anyway."
    a"Hey Kenta, we are heading toward school aren't we?"
    k"Of course."
    a"Sorry, I was just wondering, I thought more students would be around at this time, going to school too."
    k"Not at this time no."
    a"Hmm? Why's that?"
    k"We're late."
    "He says it in such a carefree way that I can't help but feel a little mad about what's happened this morning."
    "I suppose it is mostly my fault for not getting up early enough though."
    k"If you don't want to be late again I'll wake you up early next time if you'd like."
    "The picture of a bruised, purple forehead fills my mind."
    a"No, no, no Kenta that's alright I'll just set my alarm a little earlier."
    a"You shouldn't need to worry about waking me up."
    "Kenta just nods his head as we continue our steady pace through the empty street."
    "At least the walk gives me a chance to sort through my conflicting feelings."
    
    "Along the way I notice the construction workers demolishing an old traditional home."
    "That seems to be the case around here nowadays, lots and lots of new developments."
    "I suppose the average person wouldn't notice but I'm different, I haven't been here in almost two years, so I have no idea how everything is changing."
    "It's strange when I think about everything that's been built in that time."
    "It's like my entire model of what I thought this place was has been tossed out and remade, within a few seconds of coming back and seeing it all."
    "Getting used to all this isn't easy."
    
    with dissolve
    "My eyes a drawn to the only other person in the street apart from me and Kenta."
    "Across the road there's a girl, in a school uniform."
    "She looks familiar, I'm sure I know her from somewhere."
    "Being this late, there shouldn't be many people around."
    "But despite that, she's standing there."
    "Alone, waiting to cross."
    "My vision quickly sharpens as we get closer."
    "She has straight brown hair hanging down just past her shoulders and calm green eyes... I know I recognise her."
    "But I can't quite put my finger on who she is exactly."
    "Somehow a part of me hopes I don't know her, this place was meant to be a new start for me."
    "A place where I can forget about the past."
    "I try to stay away in a hope to avoid catching her attention."
    "She doesn't seem to notice me."
    
    k"Huh, so you've got your eyes on her then?"
    a"Oh ---uhh no, she just ummm..."
    k"Go ahead be honest."
    a"No, I just think I know her from somewhere, I can't remember though."
    a"Do you know her name?"
    k"I don't know her by name but I know she's a member of the student council."
    a"Hmm, know anything else?"
    k"I'm not gonna lie, I really don't know all that much about a lot of the people at our school, I just happened to see that girl walking into the student council room the other day."
    k"But apart from that I've got nothing else to tell you about her."
    "That info doesn't help me at all, and I still have no idea who she is."
    "I guess her name will come to me soon enough."
    
    "The bell's ringing as we walk through the school gates."
    k"My class is that way, I'll see you later."
    "Kenta says as he abruptly changes course and starts walking away at an extremely fast pace."
    a"O-oh, bye."
    "I call out as he walks around the corner."
    a"Crap! I'm late!"
    "Without many options open to me, I sprint off blindly, rapidly sorting through the buildings as I do so."
    "They all look about the same."
    "That's the biggest problem, none of them seem to have been built recently but they don't look especially old either."
    "I've only ever seen the school from afar when I was a child since I'd sometimes walk past here during the day."
    "The inside is pretty different from what I expected though."
    "Despite being a hurry, I can already feel this place growing on me, its familiar feel is comforting in way."
    
    "Judging from the sizes of the buildings I can only guess the largest one's for the regular, non-specialised classes, the three stories should be for three year groups."
    "There's a smaller building connected to the large one but it's hard to tell whether it's an entrance hall or administration. It's worth a look in any case."
    "Since I'm probably the only one out of class at the moment so I carefully push the door forward, ready to pull back at any moment, just in case I'm not supposed to be here."
    "I take a peek through the slightly open door, it looks like its empty inside, just like the school grounds."
    "I step through feeling slightly relieved as I continue the search."
    "The hallway splits off into a few doorways with a staircase going upward at the end of it."
    "Judging from the noise levels, this place was probably an old classroom building, repurposed for some other use."
    "This place doesn't look like administration to me but it can't hurt ot search around a little more, especially since it seems empty."
    "All the doors are open in the hallway except for the one that the end."
    "I peer through all the open doors, they're all empty."
    "Before I know it I'm standing in front of the closed one."
    "I take a moment to observe the door, the paint is peeling and the handle is rusted, it probably hasn't been opened in a long time."
    "Curiosity piqued I go to push at it."
    a"It isn't locked!"
    "A musty smell wafts out as the door creaks open."
    "It looks like a mostly empty classroom, except there are a couple of shelves on the side and a beautiful porcelain tea set sits on a table"
    "It looks like it hasn't been touched for a while"
    "The only set table is the one in the center of the room that the tea set is sitting on, all the others are stacked up in the corner of the room."
    "Four chairs sit around it."
    "What could they be used for? It doesn't look like this place has been used at all for a long time."
    "Or seen sunlight"
    "I step inside the dark room and step towards the curtains on the other side of the room."
    "I cast them aside, allowing the sunlight to pour through, drenching every corner of the room in light."
    "The features are clear now as I turn around and..."
    "----woah what?"
    "There's a girl sitting down at the table."
    "Her silver hair and violet eyes glisten in the sun's rays as she sits at the table dilegently, she doesn't seem to be paying attention to anything."
    "I could've sworn there was no one in here before I opened these curtains."
    "Maybe it was a little too dark to see...."
    a"Hello, excuse me, I'm sorry for intruding."
    "The silver haired girl seems unimpressed, she turns her head toward me with a completely blank face, devoid of all expression."
    h"Hello."
    "Her neck and a part of her lower face is covered in what I can only guess are burn scars."
    "I've seen pictures of them before, red skin with white vein-like lines running through them."
    "I step back as she stares at me, obviously aware of my reaction to the scarring."
    "Realising that I was being rude I quickly bring out an awkward smile as I think of something to say."
    a"So uh, what were you doing, sitting here on your own?"
    h"This is the only empty building in the school."
    "Her voice is monotone, and her answer doesn't make much sense."
    a"Oh, you like being alone?"
    h"Yes."
    "She seems completely disinterested as she answers."
    a"Oh, uh, what's your name?"
    "It may have been my imagination but it looked like her eyes flickered a little when I asked that, but it was gone before I could get a closer look."
    h"My name? I don't even know anymore, but a long time ago others called me Hikari."
    a"Nice to meet you Hikari, I'm Takeru."
    "I inwardly groan as I say that, she must think I'm a complete idiot."
    h"Hi."
    a"Listen, I gotta go now, could you tell me where the administration office is?"
    h"Go left, and it's the third builing on your right."
    a"Ok thanks Hikari, I'll come back later!"
    "She doesn't react in any way as I rush out the door"
    "However as I started to run I thought I heard 'no you won't' coming from behind me."
    "What a strange encounter."

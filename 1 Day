    "The light is blinding."
    "I struggle to open my eyes, and end up squinting instead."
    "...Hmm"
    "Thump!"
    "Something hit me, right in the head."
    "Thump--"
    "...Come on, I just got here... I don't want to go to school yet..."
    "--Thump"
    "I spent all of last night moving all of my stuff to this place."
    "Thump--"
    "Urghh, it doesn't seem like it cares whether or not I deserve more sleep..."
    "Thump--thump"
    "I can't be late on my first day though... what a pain."
    "Guess I have no choice."
    "Thump, thump, THUMP!"
    a"Ow ow oowwww Hey knock it off already!"
    
    "I open my eyes completely now finding myself in an unfamiliar room, with a throbbing forehead."
    "I have to remind myself where I am, that this is my new home."
    "As of today I officially live here at this dormitory."
    "----a fist comes rushing toward my head without warning."
    "I instinctively lift up my arm to block it."
    "In my sleepy daze I manage to deflect it, instead of hitting my face, the fist lands on my pilow."
    a"Hey come on, I'm up---I'm up you see! All awake now!"
    k"Hmphh, so you are."
    "I look up at the tall guy looming over my bed."
    "He's already dressed in my school's uniform."
    "It's hard for me to remember when my heads all beaten up but I'm pretty sure this guy is my roommate, his name was Kenta I think."
    "I can only hope he isn't like this every morning."
    k"Come on then, we don't have much time."
    k"You needed a wake-up call so I provided it, considering that it's your first day."
    k"I wouldn't mind much if you missed out though, you can always have your first day tomorrow, or the next day, or the next."
    k"But I still wouldn't leave it too long, at that rate you'd never finish high school."
    "I'm not entirely following this guy, I'm not sure if he's being serious or not but I don't think it's safe to ask."
    "I search the room for my clothes, I don't have time for a shower or breakfast so getting my clothes is my first priority."
    "My suitcase is to the side of the clothes draw, last night I didn't get enough time to finish unpacking everything so my uniform should be in here somewh--"
    "--All of my clothes are gone."
    a"Hey you don't happen to know what happened to my clothes do you?"
    "Seemingly focused on something else Kenta just stares off into the distance as I ask him my question."
    a"Hey Kenta, you alright?"
    k"Oh you were talking to me?"
    "Huh, there's no one else in the room... oh well."
    a"Yeah do you know where my clothes are?"
    k"Oh those things, yes I do know what happened to those. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and saw your clothes lying about next to the draws so I figured I should sort them out, it got to me you know?"
    a"Ok so where are they?"
    k"I organised them."
    "I check my draws, they're not there."
    a"Where?"
    k"Oh they're not over there, they're in my draws. I had to colour code them together or else there wouldn't be enough space."
    a"Huh?"
    k"I said they're in my draws, I had to colour code them together or else there wouldn't be enough space."
    a"No, no I got that part."
    a"But why did you mix my clothes with yours?"
    k"Like I said, there wouldn't be enough space."
    a"But I have an entire side over here, completely empty."
    k"Oh sorry, I forgot you didn't know already."
    k"Allow me to explain, before you got here I was alone in this room."
    k"And that space over there is for my collections, I've got some pretty cool stuff you know?"
    k"I had to make some sacrifices by making some room in the clothes draws, and I even gave up a collection draw for your stuff."
    k"Don't worry, I understand how much space one man can need for his things."
    "I quickly pull open the other 3 draws on my side, they're full of displays, fit with individual coins in each section."
    "This guy has to be joking right?"
    "Collecting coins has been a dead hobby for decades."
    "And even back then it was lame."
    k"You seem to have taken a interest to the 1956 set, a very keen eye you have there."
    k"I can tell you a bit about those if you like, you see the metal compostion of coins in the---"
    a"No stop please Kenta, tell me some other time."
    a"I need my uniform right now or else we'll both be late."
    k"Ah don't worry about finding that, I've got you covered friend."
    "He pulls out my uniform from the draw labelled 'darks'."
    k"Here you go, better be quick, otherwise I'll leave without you."
    "I quickly grab the clothes off Kenta and rush into the bathroom to change as he showed no signs of averting his eyes."
    a"Hey your shirt's inside out, you might want to fix that while I'm changing."
    k"Oh darn, that's the 3rd time this week."
    "I can't imagine what he's done considering it's only Monday today."
    "There's no time to think about that anyway."
    "I take a look at myself in the mirror as I begin to get ready, in a way I'm not just reflecting on my physical self, but also my mental self."
    "Already this morning has been crazy, it's pretty different to my old life...well, at least Kenta is different to anyone I've ever met before."
    "My breath condenses on the mirror pane in front of me, it's incredibly cold this morning."
    "I splash my face with the ice cold water as I inspect the rest of my face."
    "While the cold water is uncomfortable, it does do a great job at waking me up."
    "Luckily my forehead isn't bruised from the beating it took this morning, I don't know what I'd would've done if I had walked into class with a purple forehead."
    "My hair is dishevelled, even after brushing it still doesn't sit right."
    "Well it's not like it's ever done that before."
    "I guess this place doesn't have any heaters, unless Kenta is against them for whatever reason."
    "At this point I wouldn't be surprised."
    "Now I just have to change into these clothes quickly before I freeze to death."
    "After I'm finished I unlock the door and step outside to find Kenta waiting for me patiently, this time with his shirt on the right way."
    k"Alright, let's go."
    a"Sure let me just grab my bag."
    "Being my first day my bag is almost enitirely empty apart from a few empty notebooks and pens."
    "I grab my school sweater from my bag and quickly put it on, relieving myself from the cold."
    a"I'm ready now."
    "Kenta leads the way out into the hallway, it seems we're the last ones to leave judging from the lack of sound around us."
    "Everyone's probably already left by now."
    "Now that I think about it Kenta is actually pretty considerate, waking me up and waiting for me... he even organised my clothes for me--though not in the way I'd exactly wanted."
    "In any case his intentions have been good, I was having second thoughts this morning about having him as a roommate."
    "But maybe we'll become good friends someday."
    
    
    "The mountains ahead practically burst with light as the sun rises behind them."
    "The sight blinded me, I haven't seen the sun rising over mountains for a long time."
    "A warm nostalgic feeling rushes over me."

    "I wipe my eyes and rub the sleep away while my eyes attempt to adjust to the brightness."
    "The fresh air is even colder outside, but it's refreshing to be breath in. It's different to the air I've become accustommed to."
    "Which way to school...? My memory struggles to remember where exactly I should be going."
    "I'm sure it can't be far away considering I live at a dormitory but that doesn't help all that much."
    "I'd ask one of the students there but it they've all already left without me."
    "So all that leaves is Kenta, who is convinently walking right next to me."
    "I have a strange feeling that he might not be leading me to school, but I have no idea where else we could be going."
    "Despite my previous knowledge of this town's geography I have no idea where we are right now."
    "I suppose things change a lot in a year, and I never visted this area before that anyway."
    a"Hey Kenta, we are heading toward school aren't we?"
    k"Of course."
    a"Sorry, I was just wondering, I thought more students would be around at this time, going to school too."
    k"Not at this time no."
    a"Hmm? Why's that?"
    k"We're late."
    "He says it in such a carefree way that I can't help but feel a little mad about what's happened this morning."
    "I suppose it is mostly my fault for not getting up early enough though."
    k"If you don't want to be late again I'll wake you up early next time if you'd like."
    "The picture of a bruised, purple forehead fills my mind."
    a"No, no, no Kenta that's alright I'll just set my alarm a little earlier."
    a"You shouldn't need to worry about waking me up."
    "Kenta just nods his head as we continue our steady pace through the empty street."
    "At least the walk gives me a chance to sort through my conflicting feelings."

    "I'm ready to start again, but first I have to think."
    "There's not much point in rushing out without a plan."
    "I should start by looking at what's happened so far."
    "Somehow the killer always manages to leave me without harm, why?"
    "He solely goes to kill Kunikada but not me."
    "If he were a regular murderer he'd kill a witness that's close to the scene right?"
    "He also wouldn't go killing her in such open locations."
    "Unless he's just an anomaly but I doubt that's the case."
    "He obviously doesn't care if he gets caught, or has some sort of way that he can't be caught."
    "He also seems to avoid killing me."
    "He's found Kunikada twice, despite my changed decisions."
    "He wears a mask despite not caring if he's caught... does that mean he has something to hide?"
    
    "How is he so evasive?"
    "Why is he so against killing me?"
    "How has he found her two times in a row?"
    "What is his secret?"
    
    "Knowing this I may be able to make a trap for him."
    "Now I'll need to look at some realistic options."
    "Once again it'll be hard to get people like the police involved, nobody would listen to a time travel story."
    "And even if I told them a guy were stalking one of my friends I wouldn't have any proof whatsoever so I doubt they'd send any real help if any."
    "This is something I'll have to handle myself, with maybe a little manipulation if need be."
    "In any case I'll need some way to deal with him, weapon-wise that is."
    "I know my dad has a gun in his room somewhere, he tried to keep it a secret from my sister and I but I overheard my mum and dad arguing about it one day."
    "He said he wouldn't get rid of it so it's probably in one of his bedroom draws."
    "Both of my parents have left for work already so I do have an opportunity to search."
    
    "I leave my room to head down the hall, entering my parent's bedroom."
    "It is a little risky to steal the gun and take it to school in my bag but I can always reset the day if I need to so it should be fine."
    "It'd be bad to be known for the rest of my life as the school shooter if someone found out."
    
    "I search the room for potential locations, it could be in his bedside table."
    "If he has this gun for defensive purposes he'd need it somewhere that'd be easy to access to quickly protect his family."
    "Intruders tend to not make scheduled appointments."
    "Random personal belongings are scattered throughout the top two, no luck so far."
    "But the third draw is locked. My curiousity is growing, it could potentially house the gun."
    "Where is the key?"
    "Maybe it's in some other place in the room."
    "Where could it be?"
    "I search for a while unsuccessfully for the most part."
    "Until I search underneath the bed. My eye catches a glimmer to the side of it underneath the bedside table."
    "And there it was, the key was beneath it."
    "I inaudibly chuckled to myself, of course my dad put the key right beneath it."
    "While it did seem like a stupid mistake at first perhaps it was set up this way to have easy access to the in the case of an emergency, while still deterring those who casually check drawers."
    "I pull the key out beneath the table and fit it into the keyhole."
    "And sure enough, it fits. After a turn and click the draw is no longer locked."
    "I pull the draw and it slides open, revealing the very item I was looking for."
    "The gun and magazine were seperate for safety reasons but could easily be put back together for use."
    "I inspected it a little further, I wasn't too familiar with guns but had fired one at a shooting range once before so I knew about some of the important details."
    "At least I wouldn't make a mistake like forgetting to turn off the safety."
    "I slide the draw back into place and lock it."
    "The key is placed carefully back into the same position as it was before."
    
    "Just as I was heading out of the room, gun in hand, I hear footsteps in the kitchen."
    "My sister must've woken up."
    "I can't let her see me with the gun, this could pose a problem if she starts looking for me."
    "The sound of footsteps stopped in the kitchen, she either be standing still or gone back to her room."
    "I put my head slightly around the wall to check if she was still there."
    "She was, but luckily she had the back of her head facing my direction so she hadn't seen me yet."
    "My sister, has this annoying habit of waking me up every morning if I sleep in too late past my alarm."
    "I wish she'd just mind her own schedule."
    "Which means she's probably already checked my room and has figured I must've left already."
    "I stay in my parents bedroom for around ten minutes while my sister eats breakfast, while keeping watch over her."
    "The stress and boredom of sitting here had become awfully straining."
    "But just as those ten minutes were over she left the kitchen to do a few more things before leaving for school."
    "I quickly dashed out of the room across the hall to my room while I had an open opportunity to."
    "I dropped the gun in my bag and zipped it shut."
    d"Takeru, is that you?"
    "She must've heard me... I've been found!"
    "Wait a second, I just need to calm down, as far as she knows I'm not doing anything illegal or wrong."
    "I walk outside to the hallway and find her just outside of her room."
    a"Yeah it's me, Good morning Saya."
    "She looked a little surprised, she probably did check to see if I was in my room earlier but just didn't want to admit it to me."
    "Luckily for me, that worked with my plan quite well."
    d"I'm heading off now, it's pretty late so you probably want to head off soon!"
    a"Yeah, yeah..."
    "As dismissive as my response was it really was late, I needed to leave soon or I'd be late."
    "The extra time it took for me to get the gun and wait for Saya hasn't left me with much time to get ready."
    "I'll have to skip breakfast today and grab the rest of my things in the remaining 5 minutes."
    "I step outside into the brutal cold but see a letter sticking out of my mailbox, I only notice it because it has my name written on it."
    "I don't really have time to read it right now so I shove it into my bag and rush to school, not quite running but still at a hastened pace."
    "As I'm heading toward school I remember Maeko who I usually meet today, it's a shame I couldn't leave earlier today to meet up with her."
    "She's probably already at school."

    f"Class, we will be welcoming a new transfer student today so please make her feel at home"

    "Now for the rest of the day I'll need to figure out how to lure the killer out to get him away from Kunikada. In the worst case scenario I may have to kill him."
    
    "Since I left late today I didn't get to talk to Maeko so she didn't get the chance to ask me to talk to her alone."
    
    "However she did seem a little weird around me in class and we didn't talk at all."
    
    "Which means I don't even have to worry about that past obligation. I can focus on taking Kunikada home... safety."
    
    "I don't think it'll be a good idea to get anyone else involved this time or there will just be more and more causualities."
    
    "He seems to not want to hurt me and always seems to know where Kunikada is so there's not much point in me sending her off somewhere else."
    
    "The best option is probably the simplest one, just walk home together with Kunikada while keeping a sharp lookout for the masked killer."

    "The same classes go by and it's the end of the day, where all of the action begins."
    "As we leave the classroom block I meet up with Kunikada and intiate the conversation."
    
    a"Hey Kunikada."
    c"Oh... you're Ichiro right?"
    a"Yeah that's right, I'm Ichiro Takeru."
    "Just being around her felt weird, like it wasn't real. I suppose knowing someone is dead in your mind does that to you when you see them with your eyes."
    a"Just as the teacher said I'll be taking you home this afternoon."
    c"Yeah, thank you for walking me home. I hope I'm not causing you any inconvenience."
    a"Uhhh no! Not at all! I'd be walking home alone anyway so really this is fine."
    "A few painful seconds of silence continued as we left the school as I failed to bring up a new topic of conversation."
    "However she seemed to be the type to be content in being with someone without talking constantly."
    "Still, I was not that type and felt an urge to keep things from being awkward from my own perspective."
    
    a"So did you find anyone to sit with at lunch?"
    "I was sitting in the cafeteria with some of my other friends while as far as I know Kunikada stayed in the classroom."
    c"Oh ummm I did but... I don't really consider them as friends."
    c"A few girls were friendly with me and invited me to sit with them at lunch but I didn't really talk all that much."
    c"I didn't fit in, well I didn't feel that way at least."
    c"They were pretty interested about my past school and home, since I transferred at a strange time."
    c"But I don't really like talking about that sort of thing... I'd rather live in the present and make new friends."
    a"Well you can always sit with me if you like at lunch, I don't really belong to one group in particular."
    a"But it's not like I don't have any friends or anything!"
    c"Huh? Well I'm not completely opposed but I barely know you."
    a"Well you didn't know those other girls too right?"
    c"I suppose not but you're different."
    a"Different? In what way?"
    c"Never mind."
    a"No really, what is it?"
    c"Okay then."
    c"You're... a guy."
    a"It's not like we can't be friends though."
    "Her expression was hesitant but soon changed to a wide grin."
    c"Ok let's be friends!"
    c"I might... just might sit with you sometime."
    "Her cheeks began to blush but the conversation ended for a while after that."

    "I had to start thinking straight, that masked guy could come out at any moment around now."
    "To the side I saw him, the figure dressed in black with the covered face."
    "It was sure to be him."
    "He must not have noticed that I've seen him yet."
    "He hasn't drawn his gun yet and looks to be finding a good spot to aim for Kunikada while having no chance to miss."
    "But before that can happen I must stick with my theory, it's risky but I don't think much else will work at this point."
    "I rush toward him abandoning Kunikada on the spot."
    "During the rush I pull the pistol from my school bag."
    "I calculated this decision knowing that he'd miss a shot on Kunikada most likely from that distance."
    "He's noticed me now."
    "He draws his pistol and aims toward me."
    "I stop when I'm around 10 metres away from him."
    "We stare at each other for a while, my gun not yet drawn."
    "He doesn't seem to want to shoot me, if he's the murderer I know he wouldn't hesitate on any kill unless he had a reason not to."
    "So I pull my pistol up."
    "Not aiming at him."
    "But aiming at my own head."
    "While I couldn't see his sweat or expression I could tell he was agitated by my action through his body language."
    a"WHO ARE YOU?!"
    "I assert my dominance in the situation despite having both barrels pointing at my own head."
    "Despite my attitude I'm actually incredibly horrified at the thought of death but if I show it now my fate, or Kunikada's will soon end."
    a"WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST HER?!"
    a"WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!"
    "Nobody but him, Kunikada and myself can hear my shouts, nobody seems to be around."
    "But to my disappointment he makes no noise, no response."
    "I guess I'm left with no other options."

    "The walk home is so relieving to me, I feel free."
    "Being next to Kunikada for so long, not fearing the next step could result in a bullet through her head."
    "It was nice."
    "I'm making it home with her by my side."
    "I want this moment to last forever."
    "As if on cue she stumbles on a stray pebble and falls into me again"

    a"Do you need to rest a little while?"
    c"Can we just sit down for a little while?"

    "I guide her onto the park bench ten metres ahead and the moment we stop she collapses onto me"

    c"So-sorry"
    a"N-no problem"
    "I don't know how long we stayed there, but by the time she finally felt strong enough to stand, the sun was already setting"
    "We set off, every time I try meet her gaze she looks away, as if hiding something"
    "An awkward silence permeates the air"
    "It carries on until we reach our block"
    "We walk up the stairs together and we part at our apartments."
    a"Bye Kunikada, see you tomorrow."
    c"Uh-uhm, thanks and sorry for everything..."
    "It was obvious what she meant by that"
    a"It's fine, you were fun to talk to and uh, I didn't mind the diversion today."
    a"Besides, if you want to walk together in future, that's fine by me."
    c"Really?!"
    "She sounded far to excited for any normal reaction."
    a"Of course, we live right next to each other, not to mention we're in the same class, it'd only make sense."
    c"Thanks so much, I'll see you tommorow!"
    "She quickly shut her door behind her and left me in the hallway alone."
    
    "I opened my door and entered my home to find my sister and mother were already home."
    "My dad wasn't back yet, probably still working."
    "We exchange greetings until I get into my room."

    "This actually makes a lot of sense... that's why she was on the other side of the river and walking away from the school that morning."
    "She sounded like she was hiding something when she made up the story about going to the convenience store."
    "So this was it, she was dropping in to give me this letter."
    "And of course when I came out early she couldn't just head to my house, or give it to me in person."

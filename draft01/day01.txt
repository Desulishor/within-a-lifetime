label day01:

    It's the thousandth time I've woken up here with no purpose at all.
    I've never been big on reading. I can't catch baseball games any more on the TV.
    There's no one around my age.
    It's not as if I'm imprisoned here, but, if that's so...
    ...then why can't I leave?
    It's the thousandth time I've wondered whether there's anything outside worth going back to, and even if there was I wonder how I would ever know it.
    If there's a purgatory, then this is it.
    
    DOCTOR: "Takeru."
    My name brings me out of my trance.
    DOCTOR: "Sorry if I disturbed you, but it's time for our morning checkin."
    TAKERU: "No, sorry, I wasn't doing anything important."
    Doctor Meadow. He's the man in charge of my care here. A psychiatrist.
    DOCTOR: "Oh? You looked pretty deep in concentration."
    TAKERU: "Just bored."
    DOCTOR: "Well, today I have some exciting news."
    TAKERU: "News?"
    DOCTOR: "We're ready to discharge you. There's still some formalities to go and some decisions you need to make along with your parents and things like that, but we're confident that your diagnosis and treatment..."
    He fades out of my perception. Discharged. Should I be excited? Instead I just feel a panic in my gut.
    He mentioned my decision.
    DOCTOR: "Did you get all that?"
    TAKERU: "Yes."
    DOCTOR: "You'll also be happy to know that means no more tests today. I'm sure you don't mind that, right?"
    TAKERU: "No. Thanks."
    He shoots me a confidential smirk.
    DOCTOR: "But between you and me I think you just put down whatever answers you liked on those tests anyway."
    TAKERU: "..."
    DOCTOR: "I'll be back this afternoon after you'd had a chance to think things over and we'll get the forms started. Have a good day, Takeru."
    He turns his back to me and I turn my attention back to the white-washed walls.
    
    Maybe I had just put down whatever on Meadow's battery of tests, but it had got them a diagnosis anyway.
    Schizophrenia.
    It's a tough word for me. When I thought on it before, it was always a word for other people.
    Me and my friends and teammates never had time to spare for anyone like that.
    Maybe that's why none of them have ever come to visit me. Well, who would expect them to, considering the circumstances?
    My parents visit, but they never look me in the eye any more.
    Maybe they also have some feelings on having a mental patient for a son.
    Meadow said they'd get used to it. Personally I don't care about his opinion, or really about the opinion of my parents, either.
    But in the month or so since I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, personally, I haven't been able to form an opinion either.
    Maybe that's why the prospect of leaving makes me shiver, even though I detest this place.
    A psych ward. If you'd told me a month ago this is where I'd end up, I'd laugh.
    It wouldn't be a nice laugh.
    
    Two cards lie on the plastic table in the center of the room.
    The first is a form letter from Tohoku High School.
    \"We're sorry to hear about your injury. Best wishes and here's to a full recovery. We know you'll be back on the field soon!\"
    \" - Your friends at Tohoku\"
    It's form letter garbage. Sports injuries are common at any athletics-focused high school, enough that they have this glossy letter from the office ready to go.
    There's a picture of a sunset over the school baseball field on one side, and a smiling guy in a sling on the other.
    Unfortunately breaking my brain isn't quite on the same scale as a broken arm.
    I won't be back on the field any time soon. And that's the problem.
    With the massive mess I made on the way out, no doubt everyone there will have a completely different perception of me.
    Truth is, I've seen this form card from \"Your friends at Tohoku\" lying on hospital tables before.
    But when I visited my classmates for torn rotators or other mundane injuries, it was always under a stack of letters of encouragement from real friends, just like the patient was always surrounded by friends.
    No one's sent me anything and no one's come to visit. I know what it'll be like if I ever go back, so...
    I have a choice.
    Can I really ever go back to Tohoku?
    I'll be reviled. Probably I've already lost my scholarship, so I won't be able to afford it, either.
    I'll be useless there.
    It feels like I've been hit in the gut. There's no going back.
    
    I pick up the other card.
    \"Welcome to Mirako High School - A Sanctuary from the World\"...
    There's a winding road pictured. That's right, it's in the countryside somewhere. I think up north.
    Greenery lines the guardrail, and above on a hill, a school of glass and white walls.
    I wonder if that was intentional. The polished look almost reminds me of the sterile interior of my current room, this holding cell where I'm confined.
    \"Dear prospective student, we know you must have many questions before deciding to transfer to Mirako. As you discuss Mirako with your psychiatrist, here's some things to...\"
    But I've read this paragraph so many times I could recite it verbatim if Meadow asked me if I'd read it again.
    Mirako High School isn't just a school for the locals of Mirako, but a school for mental patients as well.
    Or, not mental patients per se, but people with mental illness? Psychiatric issues?
    I can't find a good term, even if I'm \"one of them\" now.
    But bottom line: it's a new beginning. A new beginning where I'll have absolutely no foothold, no special talents, no friends or (thankfully) no ex-friends turned enemies.
    The anxiety that's been hovering around me since Meadow left is starting to lift. I don't feel lethargic any more, just very very uneasy.
    I put the card down. It seems I've come to a decision.
    The Ichiro Takeru that attended the great Tohoku High School on a full scholarship is dead. I can't bring him back. I'm just too busy mourning him to move on.
    
    Thump.
    Thump thump.
    Thump thump thump thump thump.
    It's a splitting headache.
    My first day back in my new life, and fate sees fit to give me a migraine...
    Thump thump.
    I'm exhausted. I spent all night moving my things to this dorm.
    Thump.
    It's like someone's... knocking on my forehead?
    I open my eyes.
    TAKERU: "Hey!"
    If I hadn't just rollled out of the way, I'd have received another rap on the forehead from the guy standing over me.
    KENTA: "Wake up. You should've been up at 7:00."
    TAKERU: "Quit it."
    I land on the floor as I dodge him again.
    KENTA: "Wake up."
    TAKERU: "Leave me alone already. If I fell off the bad then I'm awake, okay?"
    KENTA: "You sure don't look awake."
    He's right. The room is unfamiliar, the light is blinding, and this guy is a total stranger.
    Although...
    TAKERU: "Then you must be my roommate. Kenta, right?"
    KENTA: "Undou Kenta. Yes. You need to wake up."
    I hold my face in my hands.
    TAKERU: "Right, I'm Takeru, nice to meet you I guess."
    TAKERU: "Do you always knock on peoples' heads in the morning?"
    KENTA: "You didn't set an alarm and you need to be awake for school. You shouldn't be late, especially on your first day."
    TAKERU: "There are more gentle ways of waking people up, you know?"
    KENTA: "Sorry for waking you up then. But you need to wake up. It's past 7:00."
    I swear I've lost five minutes of my morning by talking with this guy already.
    Maybe it's just too early for me but the thread of this conversation seems to be turning into a vortex.
    TAKERU: "Right..."
    
    He wanders off, presumably to get ready for school, but he already has on the Mirako uniform.
    I'm the one completely unprepared, sitting here half on half off the bed, scrunching my eyes against the light.
    Who knows where this guy was last night when I was busy carting my bags into the dorm...
    Wait.
    My bags.
    Although I could've sworn I just dropped all my junk on the floor last night, I don't see any trace of my belongings.
    The dorm isn't small, but the setup is spartan, with two desks, two dressers, two low beds, and an open doorway into the bathroom where Kenta stands combing the same strand of hair over and over again.
    But that's it. Everything's organized at right angles like a drawn floorplan. Didn't I leave my suitcase on the dresser?
    Maybe in my exhaustion I actually put my things away properly.
    With a great effort and a loud yawn I manage to extricate myself from the bed and stumble over to the dresser on my half of the room.
    This would be at lot easier if my forehead weren't throbbing. I guess I've got Kenta to thank for that.
    As I pull open the top drawer I hear a... jingle?
    There are no clothes in this drawer.
    Only a few hundred coins, some labelled, some on stands, some loose in the belly of the drawer.
    Am I dreaming? Or hell, I'm maybe the meds they gave me back at the ward aren't working right after all.
    The next drawer opens: more coins.
    With growing dread, I open the last drawer. Nope, my uniform's not here, just more damn coins.
    
    KENTA: "Hey, slow down! If you open the drawer that fast you'll knock everything down!"
    My roommate is no more than six inches behind me.
    TAKERU: "Ah! Kenta!"
    TAKERU: "W-where's my stuff? Have you seen some suitcases around here? Or a duffle bag with my uniform and clothes in it? Or..."
    KENTA: "Oh, your things. It's all where it should be."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, that stuff should be in my dresser. Or where I left it."
    KENTA: "My coin collection should be in your dresser. Clothing doesn't belong there."
    TAKERU: "..."
    TAKERU: "Your coin collection?"
    KENTA: "Yep! Coins are my passion. I'm really glad you like them too. I couldn't help but notice that you were looking at my collection. Maybe later we can - "
    TAKERU: "Your coin collection is in my dresser."
    KENTA: "Well, see, before you came here, it was my coin dresser. I wouldn't want to change things all of a sudden, so..."
    TAKERU: "Alright, look Kenta, we can go over your coins or whatever later. For now I just really need some clothes."
    This is all a collosal mistake. I should be back at Tohoku right now, scorned by everyone but at least being able to dress myself in the morning.
    KENTA: "When I woke up your clothes were everywhere, so I helped you out. It wouldn't be good if you woke up on your first day and didn't know where any of your clothes were."
    TAKERU: "Kenta I have no idea where my clothes are."
    KENTA: Everything's right there."
    He gestures at his dresser like it's the most obvious thing in the world.
    KENTA: "This drawer is for darks."
    He tosses me a uniform top.
    KENTA: "This drawer is socks. You can see from the label, of course."
    He tosses me my socks.
    TAKERU: "These are mine, right?"
    KENTA: "I think so? My stuff's in here too but it shouldn't make much of a difference."
    KENTA: "Top floor is for uniforms, bottom is for weekends. I've sorted dark colors into the right half, but make sure when you do laundry you put socks in the middle drawer. I prefer my clothes to be ironed, but if - "
    TAKERU: "Alright. Okay. I have clothes. Just let me take a shower, please."
    KENTA: "I usually shower at night. That means in the morning you have more time to - "
    KENTA: "Wait, the shampoo is arranged such that - "
    I shut the bathroom door on him.
    
    I have no idea what Kenta's deal is but I'm just going to try to do my best to find some sense of normalcy in this new place.
    As I rush through my morning routine, I can't help but feel a bit of panic. Or maybe it's dread.
    Is everyone I meet today going to be like Kenta?
    Or even worse, is everyone I meet today going to be like me?
    I splash water from the sink on my face.
    The Takeru that stares back at me is someone I hardly recognize.
    Sure, I look the same, aside from a slightly contused forehead...
    But it's the look in those eyes staring back at me.
    Did I ever feel this unsure of myself? I don't remember ever being worried before.
    Sure, I'd stress a bit about a game or a test, but today feels different, and not in a positive way.
    Maybe it's just I've never felt nervous about people before.
    All of a sudden I can't maintain eye contact with the mirror before and I go back to brushing my teeth. I'm the same person as before, schizophrenia diagnosis or not, so I'm not sure why I've let this first morning rattle me so much.
    A new part of my morning: I find my pills are still where I left them in the medicine cabinet at least.
    As I measure out the dosage and swallow, I narrow my eyes at the label on the bottle.
    \"Take once daily. Purpose: antipsychotic.\"
    It sounds threatening, almost.
    I guess you could consider this medication to be something like caffeine. Or maybe the opposite of a sleeping pill.
    In theory it's supposed to make me feel like the real me. Not like someone who's having thoughts inserted or removed from their mind at random. Someone who know's what's happening in reality around them.
    But I don't feel normal taking this.
    Normal Takeru wouldn't have to take these.
    I can tell when I haven't taken this pill and when I have. It stops... something anyway. It stops me from dreaming.
    But if it stops something like that unthinkable day at Tohoku, then I have no objections.
    Take once daily, for the rest of your natural life...
    I exit the bathroom without a second glance.
    
    KENTA: "You're finally ready! Good, you need to wake up, we're running late."
    I'm not sure my patience can take this.
    TAKERU: "You waited for me?"
    KENTA: "We're supposed to walk to school together."
    TAKERU: "Uh..."
    ...This guy's been standing outside the door this whole time?
    KENTA: "Do you even know where you're going?"
    TAKERU: "I guess not."
    KENTA: "Let's get going then."
    Wait, hang on...
    TAKERU: "Kenta, is your shirt on... inside out?"
    Kenta looks down, and sure enough, I see a tag dangling out.
    KENTA: "Huh. That's weird. This seems to happen all the time. One minute!"
    He runs into the bathroom.
    So a fastidious guy like Kenta has trouble remembering something like that?
    What's his deal, anyway?
    I guess for a school like Mirako, he's probably the norm.
    Finally, Kenta emerges from the washroom, this time with his shirt facing the right direction.
    
    KENTA: "Ah, Takeru, we need to hurry! It's really getting late."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, I wonder whose fault that is..."
    KENTA: "Come again?"
    I immediately regret my sarcasm. Kenta just looks confused.
    TAKERU: "Nothing."
    I grab my bookbag. It's uncomfortably empty, as if I've forgotten everything.
    KENTA: "You're ready to go then? Here, I'll show you the way. Mirako's just up the hill a ways."
    Kenta goes on to explain the local geography in a roundabout, if thorough, way as we head out of the dorm and onto the road.
    I'm ambivalent about him.
    Ask the Tohoku High Takeru what he thought about Kenta and I'm sure you'd find a very different answer, but I can't currently find it in myself to be mad at this guy.
    Even if he did sacrifice my dresser for a coin collection, at least he woke me up and is currently trying to get me to Mirako in one piece.
    But I still can't believe I'm relying on him.

label day01:

    It's the thousandth time I've woken up here with no purpose at all.
    I've never been big on reading. I can't catch baseball games any more on the TV.
    There's no one around my age.
    It's not as if I'm imprisoned here, but, if that's so...
    ...then why can't I leave?
    It's the thousandth time I've wondered whether there's anything outside worth going back to, and even if there was I wonder how I would ever know it.
    If there's a purgatory, then this is it.
    
    DOCTOR: "Takeru."
    My name brings me out of my trance.
    DOCTOR: "Sorry if I disturbed you, but it's time for our morning checkin."
    TAKERU: "No, sorry, I wasn't doing anything important."
    Doctor Meadow. He's the man in charge of my care here. A psychiatrist.
    DOCTOR: "Oh? You looked pretty deep in concentration."
    TAKERU: "Just bored."
    DOCTOR: "Well, today I have some exciting news."
    TAKERU: "News?"
    DOCTOR: "We're ready to discharge you. There's still some formalities to go and some decisions you need to make along with your parents and things like that, but we're confident that your diagnosis and treatment..."
    He fades out of my perception. Discharged. Should I be excited? Instead I just feel a panic in my gut.
    He mentioned my decision.
    DOCTOR: "Did you get all that?"
    TAKERU: "Yes."
    DOCTOR: "You'll also be happy to know that means no more tests today. I'm sure you don't mind that, right?"
    TAKERU: "No. Thanks."
    He shoots me a confidential smirk.
    DOCTOR: "But between you and me I think you just put down whatever answers you liked on those tests anyway."
    TAKERU: "..."
    DOCTOR: "I'll be back this afternoon after you'd had a chance to think things over and we'll get the forms started. Have a good day, Takeru."
    He turns his back to me and I turn my attention back to the white-washed walls.
    
    Maybe I had just put down whatever on Meadow's battery of tests, but it had got them a diagnosis anyway.
    Schizophrenia.
    It's a tough word for me. When I thought on it before, it was always a word for other people.
    Me and my friends and teammates never had time to spare for anyone like that.
    Maybe that's why none of them have ever come to visit me. Well, who would expect them to, considering the circumstances?
    My parents visit, but they never look me in the eye any more.
    Maybe they also have some feelings on having a mental patient for a son.
    Meadow said they'd get used to it. Personally I don't care about his opinion, or really about the opinion of my parents, either.
    But in the month or so since I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, personally, I haven't been able to form an opinion either.
    Maybe that's why the prospect of leaving makes me shiver, even though I detest this place.
    A psych ward. If you'd told me a month ago this is where I'd end up, I'd laugh.
    It wouldn't be a nice laugh.
    
    Two cards lie on the plastic table in the center of the room.
    The first is a form letter from Tohoku High School.
    \"We're sorry to hear about your injury. Best wishes and here's to a full recovery. We know you'll be back on the field soon!\"
    \" - Your friends at Tohoku\"
    It's form letter garbage. Sports injuries are common at any athletics-focused high school, enough that they have this glossy letter from the office ready to go.
    There's a picture of a sunset over the school baseball field on one side, and a smiling guy in a sling on the other.
    Unfortunately breaking my brain isn't quite on the same scale as a broken arm.
    I won't be back on the field any time soon. And that's the problem.
    With the massive mess I made on the way out, no doubt everyone there will have a completely different perception of me.
    Truth is, I've seen this form card from \"Your friends at Tohoku\" lying on hospital tables before.
    But when I visited my classmates for torn rotators or other mundane injuries, it was always under a stack of letters of encouragement from real friends, just like the patient was always surrounded by friends.
    No one's sent me anything and no one's come to visit. I know what it'll be like if I ever go back, so...
    I have a choice.
    Can I really ever go back to Tohoku?
    I'll be reviled. Probably I've already lost my scholarship, so I won't be able to afford it, either.
    I'll be useless there.
    It feels like I've been hit in the gut. There's no going back.
    
    I pick up the other card.
    \"Welcome to Mirako High School - A Sanctuary from the World\"...
    There's a winding road pictured. That's right, it's in the countryside somewhere. I think up north.
    Greenery lines the guardrail, and above on a hill, a school of glass and white walls.
    I wonder if that was intentional. The polished look almost reminds me of the sterile interior of my current room, this holding cell where I'm confined.
    \"Dear prospective student, we know you must have many questions before deciding to transfer to Mirako. As you discuss Mirako with your psychiatrist, here's some things to...\"
    But I've read this paragraph so many times I could recite it verbatim if Meadow asked me if I'd read it again.
    Mirako High School isn't just a school for the locals of Mirako, but a school for mental patients as well.
    Or, not mental patients per se, but people with mental illness? Psychiatric issues?
    I can't find a good term, even if I'm \"one of them\" now.
    But bottom line: it's a new beginning. A new beginning where I'll have absolutely no foothold, no special talents, no friends or (thankfully) no ex-friends turned enemies.
    The anxiety that's been hovering around me since Meadow left is starting to lift. I don't feel lethargic any more, just very very uneasy.
    I put the card down. It seems I've come to a decision.
    The Ichiro Takeru that attended the great Tohoku High School on a full scholarship is dead. I can't bring him back. I'm just too busy mourning him to move on.

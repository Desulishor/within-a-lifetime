Back then, I had the habit of sleeping in, and giving the snooze button a light tap the first few times.
But thanks to certain someone, even my mental alarm clock had been reset for good. 
You'd learn as much after narrowly avoiding a painful snap to your forehead.
Not to mention, given the ordeal from last morning, I had plenty of reasons to be vary.  
And so, I wake up on my own, beating the alarm clock with a safe margin. 
'Please, just no bugs or frogs, okay?'
Fearing the inevitable, I literally jump to an upright position.
Great, nothing feels out of ordinary, at least yet.
I proceed to rise from my bed, but...
Kenta: “Hold it!”
Kenta: “Just watch your steps, alright?”
I looked down to the floor and...
On the floor, several small train tracks (?) were laid out, circling the entire room and crossing with each other more than just a few times.
It was like an entire network, probably not too different from the real thing.
A model-sized passenger train stops briefly at the station right beside my feet, before zooming off, narrowly avoiding a freight train headed to the opposite direction.
I stare at the whole thing, taking in the small details and just when I feel like I'm starting to understand the so-called Zen it all brings, it suddenly hits me...
Takeru: “It's great that you found a new hobby and all but just how the heck am I supposed to get the toilet?”
Kenta: “No worries. I already thought of that too. Just follow me.”
And true enough, there were empty spots on the floor, kind of like stepping stones leading to the toilet, the room's door and my bed and closets.
Takeru: “Still, model trains, eh?”
Kenta: “They're a bit pricey compared to insects, but it really is like I heard, once you start putting it all together, it's impossible to stop.”
Takeru: “It's not, okay. You just sit down and tell yourself think for a minute.”
Kenta: “At first, I was planning on doing a scale model of the greater Tokyo area train network, but after taking the current set-up of this room to mind, I had to go for something fictional instead.”
Kenta: “But in the end, all the added planning made it even more interesting, I suppose.”
So, he actually thought of that.
Well, during the short time I've known Kenta, I've only learned that he's smart and completely unreadable.
It's not that he doesn't consider the other people around him, he just has a hard time doing so.
Takeru: “Oh well.”
Kenta: “You're pretty quiet this morning.”
Kenta: “Is something wrong?”
Takeru: “Nah, not really.”
Takeru: “Don't get me wrong, though. I'm not going to get used to this by a long shot.”
Takeru: “So, if it's possible for you in any way at all, mind giving me a fair warning the next time, preferably before the shit hits the fan.”
Kenta: “Huh?”
The expression on his face is a one that somehow signals genuine confusion mixed with mild amusement that he cannot seem to hide.
Takeru: “Wait a minute. Don't tell me you've never heard of that expression.”
Figures, he's a regular offender when it comes to taking things literally.
Kenta: “No. But I tried thinking of it just now.”
Oh boy...
Crap, I don't think that mental image is going to leave my head any time soon.”
You're sitting in your room on a particularly hot day, enjoying that gentle breeze as you continually turn your head little by little, just to stay inside the small cone of refreshingly cold air blown by the oscillating fan.
And when the urge to hear how your altered robot voice would sound like starts to set in, you spy something in the corner of your eye.
Without a warning of any kind, you slowly realize that something is small, brown and flying towards the fan with a crushingly steady speed.
Slow motion kicks in, warping your voice to a low-pitched howl, but you're already too late to stop it from happening. 
As you watch, your beloved fan slowly rips the turd into thousands of little pieces and smears them all over the walls, the floor and furniture. Not to mention...
No.
No. 
Just no... Why did I imagine that?
Kenta: “Still... Why would anyone fling that thing across the room?”
Don't tell me we even saw the same mental image!?

Even though morning had been exactly what it had been, on a more serious note, there was still plenty of things bothering me.
Did I go too far when I asked Meiko about the fireworks?
I've never seen her just break apart like that.
And I really don't need another entry to the list things I need to apologize about, when it comes to her.
  
And what about her late friend?
Was she really... Hikari?
The pieces fit together all too well, but I'm not sure if like the answer.
If she's dead, then just who have I been talking to?
Given my condition, the difference between a ghost and a delusion inside my head is pretty much technical to begin with.
I'd have to ask her to be sure, but the more I think about it, the more ridiculous it starts to sound in my head.
'Hello again, would you happen to be a ghost?' 'Indeed, I am...' 'Okay, that's great!'
As if... 
Just what kind of an answer am I expecting from her?
And what would she think of me, for doubting as much?

With all this stuck on a loop inside my head, I find myself arriving to the old school building, having made my way here almost unconsciously.
I step inside, searching for that emptied classroom which served as her safe haven.
She's been here almost every morning, right?
But assuming that much, just what am I going to say to her?

Takeru: “Heey...”
Takeru: “Are you here, Hikari?”
Hikari: “Ah, morning.” 
Hikari: “I see you're dressed like a sensible person today.”
For one reason or other, she beams with an open smile, a rare expression for her.”
Takeru: “Morning.”
I sigh casually as I return her greeting, not even bothering to respond to her verbal jab.
Hikari: “You look tired.”
Takeru: “Who knows. Maybe this is just how I look when I let my guard down.”
Hikari: “That could be.”
Hikari: “Mind if I ask why?”
Takeru: “Oh, I don't know. But between being constantly solicited for one club or the other, dealing with a certain honour student and this one oddball with an impeccable poker face... 
Takeru: This is the only place where no one really expects anything from me.”
Hikari: “Hey, I've got standards too.”
Takeru: “Right, sorry. But apart from a few weird things, you're just about the only person who I could trust without any sort of reservations.”
Hikari: “Thanks, though I think you could work on your compliments a bit.”
I know she'd rather not bother with this at all, but it's because those 'few weird things' I can't let this go. 
Takeru: “Hey, I know this is kinda out of the blue, but... Do you know someone called Meiko?”
There's a long pause, as she turns her head and looks out to the distance.
Hikari: “I might or I might not. You do know how most people are irrelevant to me, right?”
Takeru: “So, you do know her.”
Hikari: “Sigh. Just how important that girl is to you? I said I might, or I might not. And how do you know we're even talking of the same person?”
Takeru: “But you could have just denied the whole thing. 
Takeru: “So, there's definitely something and you wanted me to notice it, too.”
Hikari: “I'm already having second thoughts, though...”
Takeru: “I've come to think this much, so hear me out, okay?” 
Takeru: “There's a reason why you couldn't make tea for yourself and why none of the people you meet seem to remember you, right?”
Hikari: “I told you, I'm bad with my hands. And it's not my fault everyone keeps treating me like air.”
Takeru: “I've never seen you go to class, and you were here even at the middle of the night.”
Hikari: “I was picking up my books, and the rest is just your guesswork to begin with!”
Takeru: “And finally, there was a girl who lost her life last year, when a fire broke out during the school festival.”
Hikari: “...” (shocked expression here)
Hikari: “So?”
Takeru: “I'm thinking, perhaps you're that girl. The ghost of Meiko's lost friend.”
Hikari: “Ha ha ha...”
Hikari: “After all that build-up, that was what you had in mind?”
Hikari: “Don't tell me, this is some kind of a continuation to what you and that girl we're doing with the stupid robes and candles?”
Hikari: “Are you in league with those two weird girls at the old library now? 
Hikari: “Really, I'm a ghost now? Don't make me laugh.”
Damn it. That's a nice counter, and hearing it from someone else's mouth is just as devastating as I thought it could be.
But it's not like I'm going to stop here after coming this far.
Takeru: “For the record, those 'weird girls' are with the (unofficial and unapproved) supernatural club, and I'm not doing any of this for their sake.”
Takeru: “And well... if you're not a ghost, then how about I'll brew you some green tea right now?”
Hikari: I- I'm not thirsty right now.”
On her face, you could see the mix of disbelief and feigned ignorance.
Hikari: “Besides, the way you're trying to push my buttons is just horrible of you, to begin with.”  
She's got a point there.
Takeru: “Hikari...”
Hikari: “Just stop it!”
Takeru: “I'm not going to back down here.”
Hikari: “You were supposed to trust me.”
Takeru: “I know.”
Hikari: “Then stop looking at me like that!”
Takeru: “Please. If it's between me going crazy or the world going crazy, I'd still prefer the latter one.”
She stares downwards in complete silence.
Did I go too far? Most probably...
I wouldn't be surprised if she stopped talking completely to me after this.
Heck, I don't even want to think what came over me.
Then, without warning, she raises her head again. But she's... smiling?
Hikari: “Can you promise me one thing?”
Takeru: “Sure, anything.”
Hikari: “Just that you won't treat me differently from now on.”
Takeru: “Eh?”
Hikari: “You heard me right the first time, you big oaf! Don't make a girl spell out such things!”
Takeru: “Right, sorry. It just seemed like such an obvious thing, and moreover, I never expected you to show that kind of an expression.”
Hikari: “You're horrible.” 
Takeru: “I already said I'm sorry, alright?”
Hikari: “Humph.” 
Hikari: “Fine, then I shall accept your apology.”
Takeru: “What's with that?”
Both her and I burst to laughter. 
In the end, I don't know if talking with a ghost is any more 'sane' than talking with a girl who might or might not exist. 
I'm not sure if confirming her identity has really changed anything, but then again, why should it?
Whether or not she's 'real' to begin with, I've already made the decision of trusting her and she has returned my trust with that of her own.  

Afterwards, I was late to class for a change, but it also seems that I'm not only the absentee. 
Meiko is missing as well, though in her case, I can more or less guess the reason.
I'll have to apologize to her later...
Meanwhile, another person shares a glance with me, and though it's as if something seems off with her today, I know I can't be too careful with her.
Taking another good look at the clock on the wall, I continue planning my escape. 
I've got to bolt, as soon as morning class ends.
…

natsumi's team has lost a pitcher but takeru only considers her a pest.
As lunch time approaches, I find myself tensed up like a spring. Once again the instincts of my ancestors kick in.
Between fight or flight, not like I have much of a choice. Her persistence knows no limits.
Fighting the urge to downright run out of the classroom, I intently make my way towards the door.
Miraculously enough, the coast seems clear.
Something has to be wrong here. I know I can't afford to look back and yet...
Ah, screw it!
I take a look a back at Natsumi's seat and see her hunched over her desk, her head buried in her hands.
It's such an exaggerated expression, so wholly unfitting of her character, I'm dead sure it's got to be some sort of a trick.
It's none of my business to begin with. If she really is down, she should have plenty of friends willing to cheer her up.
Stop looking back at her, dammit...
But deep down, I know it's too late at this point. I'm way too good of person, aren't I?
Takeru: “Heyyy... Did something happen?”
And the very second upon hearing my question, she literally springs up from her seat, grabbing my hands with the most starry-eyed expression I've ever seen from anyone.
Natsumi: “Takeru... You're the only one who can help us right now.”
(onegai -nee?) (starry-eyed mini CG moment?)
I don't want to hear it.
Natsumi: “Without you, the whole team's dreams will be done for.”
I hate how easily she got one over me.
I hate the cheesy performance she's putting on.
I hate how she's doing this in front the entire class, making me look like some kind of a villain for refusing her request.
Takeru: “Huh?! And why the heck am I so special all of the sudden?”
Natsumi: “It's our pitcher, he snapped his wrist in yesterday's practice.”
Natsumi: “The verdict is already in, he just won't recover in time for the tournament, no matter what.”
But most of all, I hate how she's unconsciously bringing up my past, the past that I thought I could at least leave behind when I came here.
Takeru: “Give me break with the sob story here. It can't be that he was your team's only pitcher...”
Natsumi: “He might as well be, the others are just stand-ins! None of them look like ace material, especially with so little time left... ”
Takeru: “And what exactly makes you think I could do any better?”
Natsumi: “You were picked up by Touhoku, for one thing...”
Takeru: “That's not me. I'm not the same person anymore. Heck, I don't even understand what they saw in me back then...”
Natsumi: “Ah, well... Sorry.” 
Natsumi: “I might have overstepped my boundaries there, putting you in a spot and all.”
Natsumi: “I can tell you're probably struggling with something, but hey, we'll keep the pitcher's post open for you, in case you change your mind!” 
Geez. Just when I thought I might be out of the waters for good, she leaves it all hanging in the air like that.
I've got a feeling that wasn't the last time I'm going to hear about this.

(spirit mirror scene missing... Still a problem with Hagami's personality thou)

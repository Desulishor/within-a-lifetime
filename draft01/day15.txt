label day15:

    It's a warm feeling.
    A familiar memory. Not quite nostalgia, not something I can pinpoint as I come out of a dream.
    Like a knocking, on a my bedroom door, but somewhere closer to home.
    That's it. An ordinary knocking.
    Bap. Bap. Bap.
    A knock on my forehead before dawn.
    TAKERU: "Kenta! I'm awake!"
    KENTA: "Good morning Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, I swear, the sun isn't even up, what are you doing beating my head in? I was having such a pleasant dream too..."
    KENTA: "This is an emergency."
    TAKERU: "Something better be on fire, Kenta, or I'm going back to sleep. It's going to be a long day so I - "
    KENTA: "I'm taking the measurements. The tape measure is faulty and won't stick to the door. It's a matter of inches, Takeru. I need your help."
    TAKERU: "No you don't."
    KENTA: "I do."
    TAKERU: "I give up. What are you talking about?"
    I roll over and sit up, rubbing my wounded forehead. Kenta is waving his hands around, wielding a tape measure.
    Checking the window, the sun isn't up. Checking the alarm, I could've slept another two hours.
    KENTA: "This is a crisis, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    KENTA: "I'm taking measurements of the door frame. Yesterday I wrote down the length of the new bed and cabinet I'm assembling up in the gym, and I'm afraid all of it might be too long."
    TAKERU: "All of that junk isn't coming in here. I could tell you that without measuring. Where would I stand? Where would I sleep? You'd have to stack the beds on top of each other."
    KENTA: "Bunk beds, you say? Not a bad idea. Do you mind the top bunk? I'm not so great with heights. This also means I'll need to build a ladder..."
    TAKERU: "No. No bunks. I'm not sleeping on anything you've put a nail in, no offense. Whatever you're building, just put it..."
    TAKERU: "I don't know. Put it back where it came from after the festival is over."
    KENTA: "Disassemble it? That defeats the point, Takeru. Isn't that obvious? I just need to see if everything fits through the door, and after that, I'll be able to organize everything. But if it's too small, then, well, then..."
    TAKERU: "Okay. I'll help you measure. Let me wake up and then tell me what needs doing."
    Kenta extends the tape measure and passes me one end. It looks like the metal part at the end has snapped off, so measuring anything with this broken tool is a two man job.
    KENTA: "Stand on the other side of the door. There! That's good."
    TAKERU: "Please don't fit, please don't fit..."
    KENTA: "Excellent. The door is 40 inches wide, and then the base frame is 80 inches, and the angle..."
    TAKERU: "What's that paper you're scribbling on?"
    KENTA: "It's a diagram of our room. To fit in, the angle and the length need to add together here such that - "
    TAKERU: "This looks really complicated. Instead of putting this whole math problem together why didn't you just measure in the first place?"
    KENTA: "It's very obvious, Takeru. I'm sure you already know that."
    No, I don't really. Clearly this is some Kenta-logic that defies my simple mind.
    Instead I'll just watch him puzzle this one out.
    He scratches his head with the pencil. I sit down and yawn. Finally, Kenta turns to me. His face is white.
    KENTA: "It's a disaster."
    TAKERU: "It doesn't fit? I'm heartbroken. Guess we have to find someplace else to put all your new furniture. That's too bad."
    KENTA: "Terrible. Just terrible."
    TAKERU: "Yep. I'm going back to bed."
    KENTA: "How are we supposed to squeeze this through the door? Even if we rotate the new bed at the optimal angle, there's still two inches."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you can't give up now."
    TAKERU: "I was never trying."
    KENTA: "I'll fetch the saw from the Mirako gym. Let's widen the door."
    TAKERU: "I'm not sawing a hole through our dorm doorway, Kenta."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you have to have an idea. You seem good at dealing with these situations. What should we do?"
    TAKERU: "There's no 'we' here. The question is what you should do."
    TAKERU: "And my solution is to go back to sleep. Let's deal with this later today. I already told you there's no room in here, so let's figure it out later today."
    KENTA: "Alright. How am I supposed to sleep with this on my mind? This is a huge problem."
    KENTA: "Besides, I've already allocated out two hours this morning to figuring out the solution."
    He waves a sheet of paper at me. I recognize it as one of Kenta's timetables. Did he seriously block out two hours the morning of the festival to figure out what to do with all his woodworking? Unbelievable.
    Of course, with Kenta worrying aloud, it's impossible for me to get back to sleep. I get ready for the day ahead about two hours ahead of what I had planned.
    Guess today might be a bit stressful after all, with Kenta following me around like this. He still won't settle down about the furniture.
    KENTA: "The two hours are almost over and we still haven't figured this out. I have a bed up there. I have two cabinets up there. What am I supposed to do with the desk? How about the nightstand?"
    TAKERU: "Let's just go to the festival, Kenta. We'll figure it out later."
    I think I drift off somewhere in the next few minutes. By reflex, I roll left. Then right. But finally a blow from Kenta catches me square in the forehead and I'm forced to admit defeat. There will be no more sleep this morning.
    TAKERU: "Fine... Let's get going."
    I dress myself in the morning haze.
    Kenta's worried babbling washes over me, but I'm more concerned about what else is supposed to happen today to commisserate with his door dimension problems.
    I'm worried if something will happen to Hikari, partially. And I'm not sure how Hagami's performance will go. But all the same, I'm looking forward to today, whether Kenta was his measurements straight or not.
    TAKERU: "Are you ready to go?"
    KENTA: "No. Takeru, we still haven't - "
    TAKERU: "Oh yeah, I forgot. We're supposed to meet up with Natsumi and Meiko for today. Remember?"
    KENTA: "Natsumi?"
    TAKERU: "Oh come on. Baseball captain, school idol..."
    KENTA: "I don't know her."
    TAKERU: "She's the one that always yells 'Hey!' at you and acts like she's your best friend."
    KENTA: "Oh her. I don't have any time in the schedule for her nonsense."
    TAKERU: "It's not my plan. Tell that to Natsumi."
    KENTA: "Who?"
    Yep. It's going to be an interesting day.
    
    We start the walk to school.
    For the early hour, it's surprising how many other students are up and about. No one seems to be alone, either. Pockets of other people I recognize are making their way towards Mirako, talking excitedly amongst themselves.
    There are also people I don't recognize. There's some couples only a few years older than us, families with small children, and I even spot several old men that'd look more at place at a mahjong table making their way up the hill.
    These must be early comers to the festival.
    Tohoku never had a school cultural festival so I don't really have any point of references. For us, our games were the main attraction. Whenever we had a playoff game, or a game against our divisional rivals, we'd get an audience from all over town, plus the odd reporter.
    That's what this reminds me off. Where Tohoku had its baseball, Mirako has its festival. At least this time, there's no pressure on me to perform. I'm just here to enjoy the day like everyone else.
    Or at least, that's what I was planning. Kenta seems to have other ideas.
    KENTA: "Have you thought of anything yet?"
    TAKERU: "Anything what?"
    KENTA: "The furniture, of course. Takeru, what am I supposed to do with my carpentry booth? How are we going to get all of that back to the dorm."
    TAKERU: "You've really got a single track mind."
    KENTA: "It's printed right here. I had two hours to take the measurements and figure this out. Now I'm behind. I'm behind, Takeru. I don't like to be behind so I've got to figure out what to do."
    TAKERU: "As long as I don't end up in a bunk bed, I've got bigger things to worry about."
    I can't convince him.
    My patience is tested as we keep walking. I'm tempted to lie and tell him the tape measure was wrong and we can take all those extra beds in the first place. But I just know it would end up with me sandwiched between two pieces of wood while Kenta called it 'organized.'
    We're about halfway to Mirako before we pass the gap. At first glance it's nothing special, but this is the spot between the two guardrails where there's an overlook to the valley beyond.
    Meiko and I have stopped here a few times, but it's not a place I notice on my daily commute. Today, I only hesitate because there's a girl standing there. Her back is to me, but I think I recognize her. When I stop short, Kenta bumps into me.
    KENTA: "Takeru? What are you doing? At least apologize when you - "
    TAKERU: "Mana? Is that you?"
    MANA: "Takeru, it's you! Takeru! Hey Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Er, hi."
    MANA: "I can't believe it, I screwed up, I screwed up. I was supposed to get the prize together for the swim team, and now..."
    MANA: "Sorry."
    MANA: "Good morning! It's good to see you! You're going to the festival?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah. You said you'd be really angry if I didn't, right?"
    MANA: "Yep! I'd be so mad! You wouldn't even know what hit you! You've got to show up for Hagami's recital today! And if you missed the swim team's fundraiser..."
    MANA: "Oh... If there even is a fundraiser now..."
    TAKERU: "What's going on? What is that you're holding?"
    I think she has a plate in her hands. Or at least it looks like a plate. Except I don't know why Mana would stack a bunch of black rocks on such a nice looking white porcelain plate. Then I realize the black chunks look more like ash than rock.
    MANA: "It's my cake! Would you like a slice?"
    KENTA: "Cake? That's a cinder on a platter."
    MANA: "Oh no. Is it that obvious? I burned it a bit last night... I didn't think it was that bad!"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, be polite."
    KENTA: "Honesty is more important than manners. Who are you, anyway?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, this is my friend Mana. And Mana, this is my roommate Kenta. Haven't you met?"
    MANA: "Oh. You."
    KENTA: "'You?' Who on earth are you?"
    MANA: "I know you! You're Hagami's lab partner! You no-good work-shirking schedule-setting Hagami-scaring..."
    I realize that, no, Kenta and Mana have never met. I don't think I've ever seen Mana on this particular road and I always assumed she lived in town or in some other dorm.
    Kenta doesn't seem phased. Mana is giving him the death glare, but Kenta just looks baffled. Does he honestly have no idea what she's talking about?
    KENTA: "Who's Hagami?"
    MANA: "My friend, stupid! You were her lab partner, and you wanted to divide the work, and Hagami couldn't set up a meeting, and you kept - "
    TAKERU: "Calm down, Mana. We worked through this, right? Everything got done in the end?"
    MANA: "Well yeah, but still... I can't just let this guy go! Hagami was worried sick! He - "
    TAKERU: "It's all worked out now. Kenta, you should apologize."
    KENTA: "Apologize? Who are you, anyway? Who's Hagami? Have we - "
    MANA: "This guy's unbelievable! So insensitive! You should be grateful I don't quite know voodoo or black magic yet, mister, or else I oughta..."
    TAKERU: "Okay, never mind. Let's move on. Mana, what on earth is that you're carrying?"
    MANA: "It's one of the prizes for the swimming club raffle."
    TAKERU: "Er... You'll have to narrow it down."
    Kenta is also eyeing the plate suspiciously. I'm not sure if Mana actually tried to bake something, or else just shuffled a generous portion of volcanic ash onto a cake platter.
    MANA: "Is it really that bad?"
    KENTA: "Is that your idea of a dessert? You seem to have turned the temperature too high, or else left in to bake too long. It is distinctly inedible. I advise - "
    MANA: "I don't care about your advice! I worked hard on this cake! It's the grand prize in the swimming club fundraising raffle!"
    MANA: "Takeru... You'd eat it, wouldn't you?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    MANA: "Really?"
    TAKERU: "I don't mean to offend you, but, er..."
    Mana sighs.
    MANA: "I knew it was bad. This isn't good, Takeru! I'm supposed to have the prize ready to go for the raffle! The swimming club is putting on a fundraiser for the festival and I'm in charge of the grand prize!"
    MANA: "Um, I might have fallen asleep and left the oven on too long, um..."
    KENTA: "By the charring on the sides, I estimate you should've taken the cake out an hour before you - "
    MANA: "I don't need to hear it from you! What am I supposed to do now? Yumi will kill me! I'll be kicked off the team for sure! I promised I'd have the most delicious, the most appetizing, the most beautiful cake they'd ever seen, and now..."
    MANA: "Takeru! What should I do?"
    TAKERU: "I have no idea. I'm no chef."
    KENTA: "Takeru is not very good at problem solving in the morning."
    TAKERU: "Very funny, Kenta."
    KENTA: "What's funny?"
    I'm left to suffer in silence. Of course Kenta doesn't get it.
    MANA: "He doesn't ever seem to be that good at it, does he?"
    KENTA: "Unfortunately."
    TAKERU: "That's unfair."
    KENTA: "Stop complaining, Takeru. I need to finish setting up the booth."
    With nothing left to do, the three of us start heading towards Mirako.
    Mana and Kenta keep glaring daggers at each other and I'm afraid to walk in front of them in case a fistfight breaks out.
    MANA: "I'm nervous. Yumi's going to kick me off the swim team for sure! And even Takeru's stumped on what to do."
    KENTA: "What exactly is the problem?"
    MANA: "Well, the cake's burnt, isn't it?"
    KENTA: "You can still eat the top."
    MANA: "That's not the point! No one's going to buy a raffle ticket for three quarters of a cake!"
    KENTA: "I would."
    MANA: "Oh really?"
    MANA: "Well... thanks?"
    KENTA: "I'd pay three quarters of the full price. That's only fair."
    MANA: "Close enough. Can you um, explain that to Yumi maybe?"
    KENTA: "No."
    MANA: "Why not?"
    KENTA: "It's not scheduled. I'm very busy today."
    Kenta pulls out a sheet of paper. It's today's schedule, broken into fifteen minute increments of color coded blocks.
    MANA: "What the heck?"
    KENTA: "Booth setup is in ten minutes. I'm already two minutes behind schedule because you showed up with a cake, and another three minutes behind because Takeru was slow to wake up."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, it's almost an hour before the festival even starts, you didn't need to drag me out of bed just so you could hammer a few nails or - "
    KENTA: "Oh please. It's more subtle than that, Takeru."
    MANA: "Um, Kenta, what exactly is it you're showing?"
    TAKERU: "He assembles furniture or something."
    KENTA: "It's called carpentry. It's by far the top hobby in the country. Superior to collecting, even."
    KENTA: "Let's keep moving please. I've only allocated twenty minutes today for dealing with harassment from strangers. It's outlined here in yellow."
    MANA: "Geeze. Were you planning on relaxing today at all?"
    KENTA: "That's in green. I have half an hour before lunch. There are ten minutes before that where I have to convince Takeru to look after the booth for a bit."
    TAKERU: "I'm not looking after your booth, Kenta. I'm meeting up with Natsumi and Meiko, and it's not like your furniture is going to grow legs and run away."
    MANA: "I've heard there are spells for that!"
    KENTA: "You can't be serious."
    MANA: "I'm just saying it doesn't hurt to keep an eye out. I've seen weirder things happen. So you'll keep an eye on Kenta's booth, won't you Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "I'd probably give it all away so that junk wouldn't end up in our dorm room. I have a really bad feeling about this."
    KENTA: "I have an idea, Takeru. We can move everything down in front of our door, then I'll take out the screws and nails, we break everything down, then move it into the room, then reassemble it. Voile."
    TAKERU: "Nope. Not happening."
    MANA: "You'd say no to free furniture? And from your roommate even?"
    TAKERU: "Mana, if you show up while I'm guarding Kenta's booth, I will literally give you a free chair or something to take home. It's all yours."
    KENTA: "You. Who were you again?"
    MANA: "Me? I'm Mana! I told you that ten minutes ago!"
    KENTA: "Mana, how wide is your doorway?"
    MANA: "What?"
    KENTA: "To within two centimeters please."
    TAKERU: "Don't answer that, Mana."
    
    When we pass through the gates, I notice several student council members setting up a table and unloading boxes of programs.
    Right... Meiko is probably around somewhere. I wonder if Natsumi got her to agree to take it easy for once and enjoy the festival with us.
    No one from town is here yet. But there are plenty of classmates I recognize running around, doing some last minute setup before the festival begins in earnest.
    Every person we pass, Mana ducks behind Kenta's broad shoulders. Is she hiding?
    KENTA: "Do you need something?"
    MANA: "If you could stand there for just a sec..."
    KENTA: "Why? Why does nobody ever explain anything to me? You know everything would be a lot simpler if everyone just said what they wanted instead of - "
    MANA: "Eep! That's her!"
    KENTA: "Who?"
    MANA: "Yumi!"
    TAKERU: "The swim team captain?"
    MANA: "If she sees me with this cake it's all over!"
    KENTA: "The cake is fine. Stop hiding behind me."
    Kenta tries to sidestep her, but Mana follows him.
    KENTA: "I don't understand the problem."
    MANA: "Eeep!"
    The girl Mana is hiding from, Yumi, is way by the school entrance, but now that Kenta is spinning in circles, apparently dancing with himself, she's looking this way.
    I wave and try to pretend like I have half an idea of what's going on. The girl, Yumi, gives me a weird look then heads inside.
    Probably I just embarassed myself, but mission accomplished.
    TAKERU: "She's gone. Coast is clear, Mana."
    MANA: "Oh thank goodness!"
    NATSUMI: "Hey Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "And Kenta, too. What are you all dancing in circles for?"
    TAKERU: "Long story."
    KENTA: "It's actually very straightforward. When I was putting together the schedule this morning, I blocked only ten minutes to wake Takeru up, when actually - "
    TAKERU: "Like I said, - "
    MANA: "I swear I only set the timer for half an hour, but then when I checked, oh... It's terrible!"
    KENTA: "If you can't let anyone see you with it, why'd you bring it to school anyway?"
    MANA: "Well, um..."
    NATSUMI: "Oh, this is going to be a great day, Takeru. I can tell already."
    TAKERU: "The way I see it, I've got multiple problems to deal with already, and I'm going to have you hounding me all day."
    NATSUMI: "Yep. It'll be the best kind of festival."
    TAKERU: "What, chaos?"
    Natsumi laughs.
    It looks Kenta and Mana are busy enough arguing with each other that I can actually talk to her properly.
    TAKERU: "I surprised you're here this early."
    NATSUMI: "I was trying to catch Meiko before she got sucked in some student council nonsense, but I haven't seen her yet. She wouldn't come late to her own festival."
    TAKERU: "Maybe she snuck around the back road or something."
    NATSUMI: "Why? Who'd want to avoid me?"
    I spot Yumi from the swim team exiting Mirako, and Mana and Kenta start spinning around again.
    TAKERU: "I don't know if I can take a full day of this."
    NATSUMI: "Hey Kenta! What exactly are you all worked up about again?"
    KENTA: "I'm behind schedule. Takeru was slow to wake up..."
    TAKERU: "Two hour earlier than necessary."
    KENTA: "...and the measurements are off. I only have an hour to figure this out."
    TAKERU: "He means the furniture measurements."
    KENTA: "They won't fit through the door."
    TAKERU: "He means the door to our dorm. He wants to move all the furniture back into the room because I guess he'd prefer a piece of wood as a roommate."
    KENTA: "There's room enough for both you and the furniture, Takeru. I'm a very good organizer. How far off the floor are you comfortable sleeping?"
    NATSUMI: "I see the problem."
    Natsumi turns to Mana.
    NATSUMI: "How about you?"
    MANA: "Thank you! Thank you so much! You got that guy to actually stand still so I could hide. I think she's gone. Takeru, is she gone?"
    TAKERU: "Yumi? Yeah she went back inside."
    NATSUMI: "Uhh, that's not supposed to be a cake, is it?"
    MANA: "Well..."
    NATSUMI: "You're Takeru's friend? Have we met?"
    MANA: "I'm M-Mana, I'm on the swim team, it's my first year here."
    NATSUMI: "Hey. I'm - "
    MANA: "I know who you are. You're only the most popular girl in the school! The baseball star!"
    KENTA: "Oh, you've heard of this girl before? What's her name again?"
    NATSUMI: "Kenta, you joker. Mana, you should get along with Kenta. He's the funniest guy in the school!"
    KENTA: "No really, can you help me out here?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, easy. You don't know what to do with the furniture, so we'll have to come up with something..."
    KENTA: "That's not what I meant. And I know what do with the furniture. Takeru is sleeping on most of it. The door is the problem."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, when did you want to finish setting up your booth?"
    KENTA: "I almost forgot! Kenta I'll have to talk to you later."
    MANA: "Wait up! Hold still! Get back here!"
    Kenta walks off. Mana, still holding her singed cake, has to run to keep up.
    Natsumi gives me a weird look.
    NATSUMI: "So, about that promise... You did say you'd hang out with me and Meiko today, so - "
    TAKERU: "That took care of them though, right?"
    NATSUMI: "I feel guilty though."
    TAKERU: "Really? I didn't know that was possible for you."
    NATSUMI: "Come on Takeru, I know it's stupid early but don't be so crabby. Let's go bail them out."
    TAKERU: "Bail them out?"
    NATSUMI: "I bet I can fix this. Just you watch."
    TAKERU: "Anything so I don't have to sleep on a Kenta-made four poster bed. Let's go."
    
    Kenta must really be behind schedule. Plenty of students are milling around the gym, setting up, but I notice one or two elderly people as well. They must be early risers from Mirako, here early to check out the festival.
    I guess the gates must already be open.
    As we nagivate through the rows of booths in the gym, I'm struck by just how many of my classmates are participating. There was definitely never anything like this at Tohoku.
    TAKERU: "So how come the baseball team doesn't have a display or something set up?"
    NATSUMI: "Booo. Come on, Takeru. We weren't expecting to be here today."
    TAKERU: "Oh right. The tournament, and all."
    NATSUMI: "I'm not too hung up about it any more. It means I can at least enjoy myself today."
    NATSUMI: "Or try to, anyway. If Meiko would show up. And your crazy friends would calm down a bit."
    Natsumi points to the corner of the gym where Kenta has his cabinets set up. I spot a slightly charred cake on top of a display stand, and Mana hiding behind some shelves. Kenta is armed with a tape measure and keeps flailing his arms everywhere.
    TAKERU: "I don't know how well you know Kenta, but..."
    NATSUMI: "I know him plenty well. Watch this. Learn from the master."
    NATSUMI: "Hey Kenta!"
    KENTA: "Good morning."
    NATSUMI: "Let's take care of the furniture problem."
    KENTA: "You're here to help?"
    TAKERU: "She says that..."
    KENTA: "Oh Kenta, you're here too. Can you hold this - "
    TAKERU: "Nope."
    MANA: "Takeru! You can't be so cruel to your roommate!"
    TAKERU: "Alright Kenta. What is it this time?"
    KENTA: "The glue is setting on this one, so just push these two boards together."
    TAKERU: "Got it. How long?"
    KENTA: "Thirty three minutes."
    TAKERU: "Dammit."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi, what are you writing on that sign?"
    NATSUMI: "It's the advertising."
    MANA: "For what?"
    NATSUMI: "Our silent auction."
    TAKERU: "What? Let me see that."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you need to hold still. What's on that sign?"
    Natsumi has a big posterboard salvaged from somewhere and a permanent marker so large I can smell it even from my position in the middle of Kenta's handcrafted furniture.
    She props up the poster against a cabinet while Kenta, Mana and I all stare.
    TAKERU: "'Endou Kenta's Bespoke Woodcraftery -- Silent Auction, Today Only'"
    KENTA: "What's a bespoke?"
    MANA: "What's a silent auction?"
    NATSUMI: "Easy. Everyone comes by and sees some desks and some buzzwords. Then they put down how much they're willing to pay for each item. At the end of the day, the highest bidder wins."
    KENTA: "You're giving away my furniture!"
    NATSUMI: "Selling it. Think of it this way... You can take that cash and find a new hobby. Weren't you into taxidermy last year?"
    KENTA: "But I had to stop because the animals were too expensive... Hm..."
    TAKERU: "No more dead animals in the room, Kenta, I'm begging you. The frogs were one thing, but - "
    NATSUMI: "It's the Mirako student festival. You've got all day to find a club or a hobby or something. Take your pick. I guarantee you someone's going to buy this stuff. I'll even put my name down."
    Within a few minutes, all of Kenta's fleet of wooden constructions have a clipboard and box in front of them, courtesy of Natsumi. I guess she's craftier than I thought.
    KENTA: "I suppose this works. As much as it hurts to part with my cabinets..."
    NATSUMI: "Really it's Takeru who should be thanking be, or else he'd be sleeping under one of these desks I'd bet. You know, I'd like to see that."
    TAKERU: "Very funny."
    KENTA: "Takeru, do you want to go look around the stands? I need to find somewhere to invest my proceeds, after all."
    TAKERU: "I thought you wanted me holding this board for another ten minutes."
    KENTA: "Twelve minutes, actually."
    MANA: "I'll come!"
    TAKERU: "Weren't you hiding here from somebody?"
    MANA: "Oh! That's right! I almost forgot!"
    NATSUMI: "Who is this that you're so terrified?"
    MANA: "Y-Yumi! She's the captain of the swimming team, and if I don't have our raffle prize, she, she'll..."
    NATSUMI: "Let's see..."
    NATSUMI: "Kenta, help me carry this desk."
    KENTA: "The desk? Where are we taking the desk? You're a very presumptuous person, showing up here and bossing us around. Takeru, where do you find these friends of yours?"
    NATSUMI: "Mana, lead the way."
    MANA: "Me? Where?"
    NATSUMI: "The swim team booth."
    MANA: "But Yumi's gonna kill me! I promised a top notch prize, and now I have - "
    NATSUMI: "And now you have a custom-made 100% genuine Endou desk. It's the new top prize. Let's go."
    KENTA: "You're just giving away my desk? I'm not taking it anywhere. It's going back to the dorm."
    TAKERU: "Please no."
    NATSUMI: "Kenta, in return you get a cake."
    KENTA: "A cake?"
    MANA: "Oh! Right! It's on the cabinet there!"
    KENTA: "That's three quarters of a cake at best. I question whether this trade is - "
    NATSUMI: "Just lift the desk, Kenta."
    KENTA: "Good enough. Show me the way."
    MANA: "Over here!"
    TAKERU: "Don't mind me. I'll just hold these two planks together for another hour. See you all later."
    KENTA: "It's only eight more minutes, Takeru. Please, be precise."
    TAKERU: "Got it, got it..."
    
    I'm left alone to man the booth while Kenta and Natsumi haul the desk. Hopefully with all her hyperventilating Mana still remembers where to lead them.
    A few of the early-comers stop by. It's tough to field questions while trying to squeeze together my two boards, but most of the visitors are just confused as to why there's a wooden bedroom set in the middle of the gym.
    Somewhere in the distance, I hear the principal on the loudspeaker. I guess that must be the opening ceremonies, but checking my watch, Kenta's boards need two more minutes of pressure. I'll stay here.
    One grandfather at least enters the auction. Hopefully this is a sign that everything will sell and I won't have to haul all the unsold prizes back to the dorm.
    And of course, whenever I spot someone I know from class, I duck behind a cabinet. No way I'm trying to explain this whole setup. As long as my classmates and the Mirako residents don't show up at the same time, I'll be fine.
    That's what I'm thinking, crouched behind Natsumi's advertisement sign, when someone taps me on the shoulder.
    TAKERU: "Gaah!"
    NATSUMI: "So what're you up to there, Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, it's just you."
    NATSUMI: "'Just' me? I'm sort of offended, but I'm in a good mood today so I'll let you off."
    I dust off my shoulder and stand up.
    NATSUMI: "Seriously though. Is everyone hiding today? You were even making fun of Mana for it."
    TAKERU: "No... I just didn't want to explain to the entire school what all the furniture's for. Because honestly I have no idea what inspired Kenta to make it in the first place."
    NATSUMI: "Then make something up. You're supposed to be the salesman! I'm thinking maybe I should be the one manning the booth."
    TAKERU: "Be my guest."
    NATSUMI: "Oh cheer up a bit. It's festival today, what're you in a mood for?"
    I'm not really sure, come to think of it. The gym's full of noise, laughter, and now the smell of the grill starting up outside... I guess I'd call it fun. It's just my mind's somewhere else.
    Hagami has her performance this afternoon. I haven't seen her yet.
    Who knows where Hikari is. "Speeches from the Student Council" is still printed in the program for the closing ceremonies, but I know there's fireworks in store, and then Hikari will...
    Something.
    Maybe I just imagined all that Hagami said last night. Under the firworks, Hikari's memory will return. She won't... vanish?
    NATSUMI: "This is Terran Base to Takeru. Alien fighters, three o'clock. Do you copy?"
    NATSUMI: "Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Sorry, what?"
    NATSUMI: "You looked like you were having a war flashback there. Did you go to a terrible school festival as a kid?"
    TAKERU: "I'm just distracted is all."
    NATSUMI: "Hey, I'll cover on the booth. You go out there and check out the festival."
    TAKERU: "Er, thanks. No sign of Meiko then?"
    NATSUMI: "She was at the opening ceremony. Said she'd be free after lunch."
    NATSUMI: "If you see her though, you guys get right back here, okay? Drag her back if necessary. No having fun without me."
    TAKERU: "Got it."
    NATSUMI: "Oh, and see if you can find Mana and Kenta. I left them unsupervised after we dropped off the desk, and uh, your friend Mana seems like she's more likely to injure herself than even Kenta."
    TAKERU: "Kenta mostly just injures me..."
    TAKERU: "I'll try and find them. Where did they go?"
    NATSUMI: "They're still in the gym, I think. Kenta's got to find himself a new hobby, after all."
    TAKERU: "I'd better hurry up before Mana gets him hooking on voodoo. Thank goodness the supernatural club doesn't have anything set up."
    NATSUMI: "We have a supernatural club?"
    TAKERU: "You're not invited."
    NATSUMI: "Fine, fine. See you later, Takeru, and try to enjoy yourself a little."
    
    Even with the loading dock open, the side door propped, and the windows all ajar, the gym is almost stuffy. Must be all the people here today.
    It's almost hard to walk through all the aisles. There must be more visitors here than at a Tohoku home game. I guess Meiko and the others weren't exaggerating when they said the Mirako festival was famous.
    I wave hello at a few whose names I barely know and try to take in the displays. Most clubs are here. The sports teams all seem to have fundraisers. And all along the far wall and spilling into the outdoors, individual students have booths set up.
    And food. The student council has that industrial grill set up, and more than a few student groups are cooking as well.
    Come to think of it, maybe it is unusual the supernatural club doesn't have anything set up. But Mana's also on the swim team, Hagami has her recital... And at Tohoku, I definitely never had to worry about funding the baseball team.
    And Hikari, of course she couldn't have anything set up. So that's why even as an official club, us supernatural members are without a -
    Wait.
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    HIKARI: "Takeru."
    That is her, right? Standing by one of the student display stands, two or three people pressing in?
    I think I even recognize her audience. That's not...
    MANA: "Takeru! Hey Kenta, it's Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Hey."
    KENTA: "Good afternoon, Takeru. How long did you hold the boards? Did the joint set properly? And who's manning the booth?"
    TAKERU: "Eight minutes on the clock, the chair is fine, and I roped Natsumi into running the auction. Your furniture is safe."
    TAKERU: "She said I'm supposed to find you a new club or hobby or something. I guess you're just visiting Hikari, though."
    TAKERU: "Er, Hikari, what exactly are... How...?"
    HIKARI: "I've always been able to come and go as I liked. This wasn't too hard to arrange."
    She gestures at the table in front of her. It's a bit of a slipshod display, just a card table. On it I recognize the newly carved chess set. There are also a few more wooden figurines, mostly rabbits with a few cats and other animals mixed in.
    TAKERU: "You're selling these?"
    HIKARI: "My carvings. It felt familiar."
    KENTA: "There was a booth like this last year."
    HIKARI: "That's probably it. I can't remember too clearly, but I know I put in the paperwork. Last year's festival, I was set up over... No, I don't know."
    HIKARI: "You, do you remember who was at that booth?"
    KENTA: "I don't remember her name."
    HIKARI: "As expected."
    TAKERU: "That's Kenta for you. Don't worry, Hikari, half the time I'm surprised he remembers my name."
    MANA: "H-Hikari?"
    HIKARI: "...What?"
    MANA: "That's your name, isn't it? I knew it!"
    HIKARI: "Of course it's my name. What did you - "
    MANA: "Hagami told me all about you! You're a Demon-rank sorceress and you have the gift of foresight, and you want to start a coven in Mirako and - "
    HIKARI: "Your friend Hagami is a notorious and mean-spirited liar."
    MANA: "Hagami would never lie to me!"
    HIKARI: "But she'd mislead you for her own amusement."
    MANA: "W-well..."
    KENTA: "I thought you were here displaying whittling and crafting. Is this some sort of black magic display?"
    MANA: "Hikari's amazing! Probably she used her psychic powers to help make her art! Right Hikari? Or was it your Taoist powers you used? I always get those confused with the - "
    HIKARI: "I used my knife powers."
    TAKERU: "Sounds dangerous."
    KENTA: "No that sounds interesting. How much does a whittling knife cost?"
    HIKARI: "I'm not really selling anything, but it's probably cheap at a hardware store. And I think I just found mine in an art class or storage room somewhere."
    KENTA: "Carving is a type of woodworking, after all..."
    KENTA: "Consider me interested."
    MANA: "You're going to learn tantric carving from Hikari? I want to learn too! I'd do anything to - "
    KENTA: "No I'm just considering learning the basics of carving."
    KENTA: "Although... That would generate a lot of wood shavings."
    HIKARI: "...I never really considered that a problem."
    KENTA: "It might inconvenience my roommate."
    TAKERU: "Are you kidding me? It's small. It's not expensive. It doesn't create something that if I'm unlucky I have to sleep on. Go for it, Kenta. Learn to carve."
    KENTA: "I'll consider your advice, Takeru. It all depends if the sales from the silent auction are enough to cover the knife."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, you've got two beds up there, a trophy case, that chest of drawers, a chair that I just held together for half an hour - "
    KENTA: "Thirty-eight minutes."
    TAKERU: " - and you're worried about how much a pocket knife is going to cost?"
    KENTA: "What if there are no bids? I don't want to lose money."
    TAKERU: "Mirako's senior citizens seem to be interested in your furniture so I wouldn't worry."
    KENTA: "How much is the knife then?"
    HIKARI: "Not for sale."
    KENTA: "This is a problem, Takeru. If the carving knife isn't for sale, no matter how much money the auction raises, I won't be able to - "
    TAKERU: "The hobby shop. We're going tomorrow. And we'll buy you a knife."
    KENTA: "That's very kind of you, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Tell me about it..."
    MANA: "Can I come?"
    TAKERU: "Why not?"
    KENTA: "Excuse me. Have you ever been in a hobby shop?"
    MANA: "A hobby shop? I have tons of hobbies."
    KENTA: "My apologies. You looked like a very boring person."
    MANA: "A boring person!? Are you kidding me? I'll have you know..."
    I rub my forehead as Mana and Kenta start at it again. I really can't tell if they're getting along or if they're mortal enemies.
    Hopefully they're not mortal enemies because if they start their final showdown in the middle of the festival, I'm not stepping in.
    
    if hikari_route:
        Hikari watches alongside me.
        HIKARI: "So she remembers what Hagami's told her, but doesn't remember meeting me at all."
        HIKARI: "But Hagami doesn't forget."
        TAKERU: "She's... odd."
        HIKARI: "Takeru, do you really believe her?"
        TAKERU: "About what?"
        I try my best not to show anything on my face, but I'm startled.
        Hagami hasn't told Hikari about her real suspicions, has she?
        HIKARI: "We'll see the fireworks together, and it'll all come back."
        TAKERU: "Hagami wouldn't lie."
        HIKARI: "Would you?"
        TAKERU: "Er..."
        HIKARI: "You don't have to protect me, you know. I can handle it. I've been through a lot more than you and a lot worse than this."
        HIKARI: "I can handle the truth."
        TAKERU: "I..."
        TAKERU: "Sorry, Hikari, my head hurts."
        That's not a lie. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Hagami initially told us all the lie about the fireworks restoring Hikari's memory when Mana was around, so as to not upset her.
        Mana would overreact, probably break down in tears. Then she'd forget. Then she'd break down again.
        But... Did Hagami ever really intend to hide that from Hikari? It seems cruel. Like lying to an animal before it's euthanized.
        I shudder. But I can't break that kind of news to Hikari, here, now. Maybe I'm trying to protect myself more than her.
        HIKARI: "How about we go for a walk? It's crowded in here."
        TAKERU: "You're not worried about your table?"
        HIKARI: "People steal my work all the time so it's not such a big deal. Anyway, everyone's doing it."
        True, most of the display booths are unmanned. No one would want to man a table when there's so much else to do at the festival.
        TAKERU: "Right. Where to?"
        HIKARI: "Somewhere quiet."
        We up inside, in the old wing. In my opinion, it's even stuffier in this dusty hallway than the gym, but I guess to Hikari this is what counts as comfortable.
        For a while, Hikari doesn't speak. She's frowning even more heavily than usual.
        HIKARI: "The fireworks aren't announced in the program, you know."
        TAKERU: "Yeah. It's going to be a surprise. Meiko set up everything last minute."
        HIKARI: "You're sure?"
        TAKERU: "Meiko keeps her word."
        TAKERU: "...You're actually looking forward to the fireworks show."
        HIKARI: "Of course I am. Didn't I say that?"
        TAKERU: "I guess. You've always been sort of... Er..."
        TAKERU: "Abstract."
        TAKERU: "It seems funny to me that you're actually enthusiastic about something like fireworks. When I haven't really seen you happy about anything except maybe beating me at chess."
        HIKARI: "You don't think I'm a happy, cheerful, person?"
        TAKERU: "Er, no, I mean - "
        Hikari laughs.
        HIKARI: "That's fine. I'm literally dead, it looks like. My chance at real happiness is shot, I admit. So I'll take whatever cheap thrill I can get at fireworks. Even if it's the last thing I do."
        HIKARI: "I don't really fear death because that already happened, and I've already forgot most of the people I met and knew last year... So that doesn't scare me much any more."
        HIKARI: "That's why I want to know. Even if there's nothing pleasant at the end of the tunnel, even if I'll just..."
        She's giving me a strange look. Concentrating?
        Then suddenly she breaks eye contact. Over my shoulder? There's a creak. A door opens behind us and I turn around.
        HIKARI: "I'll see you."
        TAKERU: "Hikari? Where are you..."
        She's gone before I could even look at her.

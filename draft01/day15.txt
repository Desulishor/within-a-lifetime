label day15:

    It's a warm feeling.
    A familiar memory. Not quite nostalgia, not something I can pinpoint as I come out of a dream.
    Like a knocking, on a my bedroom door, but somewhere closer to home.
    That's it. An ordinary knocking.
    Bap. Bap. Bap.
    A knock on my forehead before dawn.
    TAKERU: "Kenta! I'm awake!"
    KENTA: "Good morning Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, I swear, the sun isn't even up, what are you doing beating my head in? I was having such a pleasant dream too..."
    KENTA: "This is an emergency."
    TAKERU: "Something better be on fire, Kenta, or I'm going back to sleep. It's going to be a long day so I - "
    KENTA: "I'm taking the measurements. The tape measure is faulty and won't stick to the door. It's a matter of inches, Takeru. I need your help."
    TAKERU: "No you don't."
    KENTA: "I do."
    TAKERU: "I give up. What are you talking about?"
    I roll over and sit up, rubbing my wounded forehead. Kenta is waving his hands around, wielding a tape measure.
    Checking the window, the sun isn't up. Checking the alarm, I could've slept another two hours.
    KENTA: "This is a crisis, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    KENTA: "I'm taking measurements of the door frame. Yesterday I wrote down the length of the new bed and cabinet I'm assembling up in the gym, and I'm afraid all of it might be too long."
    TAKERU: "All of that junk isn't coming in here. I could tell you that without measuring. Where would I stand? Where would I sleep? You'd have to stack the beds on top of each other."
    KENTA: "Bunk beds, you say? Not a bad idea. Do you mind the top bunk? I'm not so great with heights. This also means I'll need to build a ladder..."
    TAKERU: "No. No bunks. I'm not sleeping on anything you've put a nail in, no offense. Whatever you're building, just put it..."
    TAKERU: "I don't know. Put it back where it came from after the festival is over."
    KENTA: "Disassemble it? That defeats the point, Takeru. Isn't that obvious? I just need to see if everything fits through the door, and after that, I'll be able to organize everything. But if it's too small, then, well, then..."
    TAKERU: "Okay. I'll help you measure. Let me wake up and then tell me what needs doing."
    Kenta extends the tape measure and passes me one end. It looks like the metal part at the end has snapped off, so measuring anything with this broken tool is a two man job.
    KENTA: "Stand on the other side of the door. There! That's good."
    TAKERU: "Please don't fit, please don't fit..."
    KENTA: "Excellent. The door is 40 inches wide, and then the base frame is 80 inches, and the angle..."
    TAKERU: "What's that paper you're scribbling on?"
    KENTA: "It's a diagram of our room. To fit in, the angle and the length need to add together here such that - "
    TAKERU: "This looks really complicated. Instead of putting this whole math problem together why didn't you just measure in the first place?"
    KENTA: "It's very obvious, Takeru. I'm sure you already know that."
    No, I don't really. Clearly this is some Kenta-logic that defies my simple mind.
    Instead I'll just watch him puzzle this one out.
    He scratches his head with the pencil. I sit down and yawn. Finally, Kenta turns to me. His face is white.
    KENTA: "It's a disaster."
    TAKERU: "It doesn't fit? I'm heartbroken. Guess we have to find someplace else to put all your new furniture. That's too bad."
    KENTA: "Terrible. Just terrible."
    TAKERU: "Yep. I'm going back to bed."
    KENTA: "How are we supposed to squeeze this through the door? Even if we rotate the new bed at the optimal angle, there's still two inches."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you can't give up now."
    TAKERU: "I was never trying."
    KENTA: "I'll fetch the saw from the Mirako gym. Let's widen the door."
    TAKERU: "I'm not sawing a hole through our dorm doorway, Kenta."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you have to have an idea. You seem good at dealing with these situations. What should we do?"
    TAKERU: "There's no 'we' here. The question is what you should do."
    TAKERU: "And my solution is to go back to sleep. Let's deal with this later today. I already told you there's no room in here, so let's figure it out later today."
    KENTA: "Alright. How am I supposed to sleep with this on my mind? This is a huge problem."
    KENTA: "Besides, I've already allocated out two hours this morning to figuring out the solution."
    He waves a sheet of paper at me. I recognize it as one of Kenta's timetables. Did he seriously block out two hours the morning of the festival to figure out what to do with all his woodworking? Unbelievable.
    Of course, with Kenta worrying aloud, it's impossible for me to get back to sleep. I get ready for the day ahead about two hours ahead of what I had planned.
    Guess today might be a bit stressful after all, with Kenta following me around like this. He still won't settle down about the furniture.
    KENTA: "The two hours are almost over and we still haven't figured this out. I have a bed up there. I have two cabinets up there. What am I supposed to do with the desk? How about the nightstand?"
    TAKERU: "Let's just go to the festival, Kenta. We'll figure it out later."
    I think I drift off somewhere in the next few minutes. By reflex, I roll left. Then right. But finally a blow from Kenta catches me square in the forehead and I'm forced to admit defeat. There will be no more sleep this morning.
    TAKERU: "Fine... Let's get going."
    I dress myself in the morning haze.
    Kenta's worried babbling washes over me, but I'm more concerned about what else is supposed to happen today to commisserate with his door dimension problems.
    I'm worried if something will happen to Hikari, partially. And I'm not sure how Hagami's performance will go. But all the same, I'm looking forward to today, whether Kenta was his measurements straight or not.
    TAKERU: "Are you ready to go?"
    KENTA: "No. Takeru, we still haven't - "
    TAKERU: "Oh yeah, I forgot. We're supposed to meet up with Natsumi and Meiko for today. Remember?"
    KENTA: "Natsumi?"
    TAKERU: "Oh come on. Baseball captain, school idol..."
    KENTA: "I don't know her."
    TAKERU: "She's the one that always yells 'Hey!' at you and acts like she's your best friend."
    KENTA: "Oh her. I don't have any time in the schedule for her nonsense."
    TAKERU: "It's not my plan. Tell that to Natsumi."
    KENTA: "Who?"
    Yep. It's going to be an interesting day.
    
    We start the walk to school.
    For the early hour, it's surprising how many other students are up and about. No one seems to be alone, either. Pockets of other people I recognize are making their way towards Mirako, talking excitedly amongst themselves.
    There are also people I don't recognize. There's some couples only a few years older than us, families with small children, and I even spot several old men that'd look more at place at a mahjong table making their way up the hill.
    These must be early comers to the festival.
    Tohoku never had a school cultural festival so I don't really have any point of references. For us, our games were the main attraction. Whenever we had a playoff game, or a game against our divisional rivals, we'd get an audience from all over town, plus the odd reporter.
    That's what this reminds me off. Where Tohoku had its baseball, Mirako has its festival. At least this time, there's no pressure on me to perform. I'm just here to enjoy the day like everyone else.
    Or at least, that's what I was planning. Kenta seems to have other ideas.
    KENTA: "Have you thought of anything yet?"
    TAKERU: "Anything what?"
    KENTA: "The furniture, of course. Takeru, what am I supposed to do with my carpentry booth? How are we going to get all of that back to the dorm."
    TAKERU: "You've really got a single track mind."
    KENTA: "It's printed right here. I had two hours to take the measurements and figure this out. Now I'm behind. I'm behind, Takeru. I don't like to be behind so I've got to figure out what to do."
    TAKERU: "As long as I don't end up in a bunk bed, I've got bigger things to worry about."
    I can't convince him.
    My patience is tested as we keep walking. I'm tempted to lie and tell him the tape measure was wrong and we can take all those extra beds in the first place. But I just know it would end up with me sandwiched between two pieces of wood while Kenta called it 'organized.'
    We're about halfway to Mirako before we pass the gap. At first glance it's nothing special, but this is the spot between the two guardrails where there's an overlook to the valley beyond.
    Meiko and I have stopped here a few times, but it's not a place I notice on my daily commute. Today, I only hesitate because there's a girl standing there. Her back is to me, but I think I recognize her. When I stop short, Kenta bumps into me.
    KENTA: "Takeru? What are you doing? At least apologize when you - "
    TAKERU: "Mana? Is that you?"
    MANA: "Takeru, it's you! Takeru! Hey Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Er, hi."
    MANA: "I can't believe it, I screwed up, I screwed up. I was supposed to get the prize together for the swim team, and now..."
    MANA: "Sorry."
    MANA: "Good morning! It's good to see you! You're going to the festival?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah. You said you'd be really angry if I didn't, right?"
    MANA: "Yep! I'd be so mad! You wouldn't even know what hit you! You've got to show up for Hagami's recital today! And if you missed the swim team's fundraiser..."
    MANA: "Oh... If there even is a fundraiser now..."
    TAKERU: "What's going on? What is that you're holding?"
    I think she has a plate in her hands. Or at least it looks like a plate. Except I don't know why Mana would stack a bunch of black rocks on such a nice looking white porcelain plate. Then I realize the black chunks look more like ash than rock.
    MANA: "It's my cake! Would you like a slice?"
    KENTA: "Cake? That's a cinder on a platter."
    MANA: "Oh no. Is it that obvious? I burned it a bit last night... I didn't think it was that bad!"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, be polite."
    KENTA: "Honesty is more important than manners. Who are you, anyway?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, this is my friend Mana. And Mana, this is my roommate Kenta. Haven't you met?"
    MANA: "Oh. You."
    KENTA: "'You?' Who on earth are you?"
    MANA: "I know you! You're Hagami's lab partner! You no-good work-shirking schedule-setting Hagami-scaring..."
    I realize that, no, Kenta and Mana have never met. I don't think I've ever seen Mana on this particular road and I always assumed she lived in town or in some other dorm.
    Kenta doesn't seem phased. Mana is giving him the death glare, but Kenta just looks baffled. Does he honestly have no idea what she's talking about?
    KENTA: "Who's Hagami?"
    MANA: "My friend, stupid! You were her lab partner, and you wanted to divide the work, and Hagami couldn't set up a meeting, and you kept - "
    TAKERU: "Calm down, Mana. We worked through this, right? Everything got done in the end?"
    MANA: "Well yeah, but still... I can't just let this guy go! Hagami was worried sick! He - "
    TAKERU: "It's all worked out now. Kenta, you should apologize."
    KENTA: "Apologize? Who are you, anyway? Who's Hagami? Have we - "
    MANA: "This guy's unbelievable! So insensitive! You should be grateful I don't quite know voodoo or black magic yet, mister, or else I oughta..."
    TAKERU: "Okay, never mind. Let's move on. Mana, what on earth is that you're carrying?"
    MANA: "It's one of the prizes for the swimming club raffle."
    TAKERU: "Er... You'll have to narrow it down."
    Kenta is also eyeing the plate suspiciously. I'm not sure if Mana actually tried to bake something, or else just shuffled a generous portion of volcanic ash onto a cake platter.
    MANA: "Is it really that bad?"
    KENTA: "Is that your idea of a dessert? You seem to have turned the temperature too high, or else left in to bake too long. It is distinctly inedible. I advise - "
    MANA: "I don't care about your advice! I worked hard on this cake! It's the grand prize in the swimming club fundraising raffle!"
    MANA: "Takeru... You'd eat it, wouldn't you?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    MANA: "Really?"
    TAKERU: "I don't mean to offend you, but, er..."
    Mana sighs.
    MANA: "I knew it was bad. This isn't good, Takeru! I'm supposed to have the prize ready to go for the raffle! The swimming club is putting on a fundraiser for the festival and I'm in charge of the grand prize!"
    MANA: "Um, I might have fallen asleep and left the oven on too long, um..."
    KENTA: "By the charring on the sides, I estimate you should've taken the cake out an hour before you - "
    MANA: "I don't need to hear it from you! What am I supposed to do now? Yumi will kill me! I'll be kicked off the team for sure! I promised I'd have the most delicious, the most appetizing, the most beautiful cake they'd ever seen, and now..."
    MANA: "Takeru! What should I do?"
    TAKERU: "I have no idea. I'm no chef."
    KENTA: "Takeru is not very good at problem solving in the morning."
    TAKERU: "Very funny, Kenta."
    KENTA: "What's funny?"
    I'm left to suffer in silence. Of course Kenta doesn't get it.
    MANA: "He doesn't ever seem to be that good at it, does he?"
    KENTA: "Unfortunately."
    TAKERU: "That's unfair."
    KENTA: "Stop complaining, Takeru. I need to finish setting up the booth."
    With nothing left to do, the three of us start heading towards Mirako.
    Mana and Kenta keep glaring daggers at each other and I'm afraid to walk in front of them in case a fistfight breaks out.
    MANA: "I'm nervous. Yumi's going to kick me off the swim team for sure! And even Takeru's stumped on what to do."
    KENTA: "What exactly is the problem?"
    MANA: "Well, the cake's burnt, isn't it?"
    KENTA: "You can still eat the top."
    MANA: "That's not the point! No one's going to buy a raffle ticket for three quarters of a cake!"
    KENTA: "I would."
    MANA: "Oh really?"
    MANA: "Well... thanks?"
    KENTA: "I'd pay three quarters of the full price. That's only fair."
    MANA: "Close enough. Can you um, explain that to Yumi maybe?"
    KENTA: "No."
    MANA: "Why not?"
    KENTA: "It's not scheduled. I'm very busy today."
    Kenta pulls out a sheet of paper. It's today's schedule, broken into fifteen minute increments of color coded blocks.
    MANA: "What the heck?"
    KENTA: "Booth setup is in ten minutes. I'm already two minutes behind schedule because you showed up with a cake, and another three minutes behind because Takeru was slow to wake up."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, it's almost an hour before the festival even starts, you didn't need to drag me out of bed just so you could hammer a few nails or - "
    KENTA: "Oh please. It's more subtle than that, Takeru."
    MANA: "Um, Kenta, what exactly is it you're showing?"
    TAKERU: "He assembles furniture or something."
    KENTA: "It's called carpentry. It's by far the top hobby in the country. Superior to collecting, even."
    KENTA: "Let's keep moving please. I've only allocated twenty minutes today for dealing with harassment from strangers. It's outlined here in yellow."
    MANA: "Geeze. Were you planning on relaxing today at all?"
    KENTA: "That's in green. I have half an hour before lunch. There are ten minutes before that where I have to convince Takeru to look after the booth for a bit."
    TAKERU: "I'm not looking after your booth, Kenta. I'm meeting up with Natsumi and Meiko, and it's not like your furniture is going to grow legs and run away."
    MANA: "I've heard there are spells for that!"
    KENTA: "You can't be serious."
    MANA: "I'm just saying it doesn't hurt to keep an eye out. I've seen weirder things happen. So you'll keep an eye on Kenta's booth, won't you Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "I'd probably give it all away so that junk wouldn't end up in our dorm room. I have a really bad feeling about this."
    KENTA: "I have an idea, Takeru. We can move everything down in front of our door, then I'll take out the screws and nails, we break everything down, then move it into the room, then reassemble it. Voile."
    TAKERU: "Nope. Not happening."
    MANA: "You'd say no to free furniture? And from your roommate even?"
    TAKERU: "Mana, if you show up while I'm guarding Kenta's booth, I will literally give you a free chair or something to take home. It's all yours."
    KENTA: "You. Who were you again?"
    MANA: "Me? I'm Mana! I told you that ten minutes ago!"
    KENTA: "Mana, how wide is your doorway?"
    MANA: "What?"
    KENTA: "To within two centimeters please."
    TAKERU: "Don't answer that, Mana."
    
    When we pass through the gates, I notice several student council members setting up a table and unloading boxes of programs.
    Right... Meiko is probably around somewhere. I wonder if Natsumi got her to agree to take it easy for once and enjoy the festival with us.
    No one from town is here yet. But there are plenty of classmates I recognize running around, doing some last minute setup before the festival begins in earnest.
    Every person we pass, Mana ducks behind Kenta's broad shoulders. Is she hiding?
    KENTA: "Do you need something?"
    MANA: "If you could stand there for just a sec..."
    KENTA: "Why? Why does nobody ever explain anything to me? You know everything would be a lot simpler if everyone just said what they wanted instead of - "
    MANA: "Eep! That's her!"
    KENTA: "Who?"
    MANA: "Yumi!"
    TAKERU: "The swim team captain?"
    MANA: "If she sees me with this cake it's all over!"
    KENTA: "The cake is fine. Stop hiding behind me."
    Kenta tries to sidestep her, but Mana follows him.
    KENTA: "I don't understand the problem."
    MANA: "Eeep!"
    The girl Mana is hiding from, Yumi, is way by the school entrance, but now that Kenta is spinning in circles, apparently dancing with himself, she's looking this way.
    I wave and try to pretend like I have half an idea of what's going on. The girl, Yumi, gives me a weird look then heads inside.
    Probably I just embarassed myself, but mission accomplished.
    TAKERU: "She's gone. Coast is clear, Mana."
    MANA: "Oh thank goodness!"
    NATSUMI: "Hey Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Natsumi?"
    NATSUMI: "And Kenta, too. What are you all dancing in circles for?"
    TAKERU: "Long story."
    KENTA: "It's actually very straightforward. When I was putting together the schedule this morning, I blocked only ten minutes to wake Takeru up, when actually - "
    TAKERU: "Like I said, - "
    MANA: "I swear I only set the timer for half an hour, but then when I checked, oh... It's terrible!"
    KENTA: "If you can't let anyone see you with it, why'd you bring it to school anyway?"
    MANA: "Well, um..."
    NATSUMI: "Oh, this is going to be a great day, Takeru. I can tell already."
    TAKERU: "The way I see it, I've got multiple problems to deal with already, and I'm going to have you hounding me all day."
    NATSUMI: "Yep. It'll be the best kind of festival."
    TAKERU: "What, chaos?"
    Natsumi laughs.
    It looks Kenta and Mana are busy enough arguing with each other that I can actually talk to her properly.
    TAKERU: "I surprised you're here this early."
    NATSUMI: "I was trying to catch Meiko before she got sucked in some student council nonsense, but I haven't seen her yet. She wouldn't come late to her own festival."
    TAKERU: "Maybe she snuck around the back road or something."
    NATSUMI: "Why? Who'd want to avoid me?"
    I spot Yumi from the swim team exiting Mirako, and Mana and Kenta start spinning around again.
    TAKERU: "I don't know if I can take a full day of this."
    NATSUMI: "Hey Kenta! What exactly are you all worked up about again?"
    KENTA: "I'm behind schedule. Takeru was slow to wake up..."
    TAKERU: "Two hour earlier than necessary."
    KENTA: "...and the measurements are off. I only have an hour to figure this out."
    TAKERU: "He means the furniture measurements."
    KENTA: "They won't fit through the door."
    TAKERU: "He means the door to our dorm. He wants to move all the furniture back into the room because I guess he'd prefer a piece of wood as a roommate."
    KENTA: "There's room enough for both you and the furniture, Takeru. I'm a very good organizer. How far off the floor are you comfortable sleeping?"
    NATSUMI: "I see the problem."
    Natsumi turns to Mana.
    NATSUMI: "How about you?"
    MANA: "Thank you! Thank you so much! You got that guy to actually stand still so I could hide. I think she's gone. Takeru, is she gone?"
    TAKERU: "Yumi? Yeah she went back inside."
    NATSUMI: "Uhh, that's not supposed to be a cake, is it?"
    MANA: "Well..."
    NATSUMI: "You're Takeru's friend? Have we met?"
    MANA: "I'm M-Mana, I'm on the swim team, it's my first year here."
    NATSUMI: "Hey. I'm - "
    MANA: "I know who you are. You're only the most popular girl in the school! The baseball star!"
    KENTA: "Oh, you've heard of this girl before? What's her name again?"
    NATSUMI: "Kenta, you joker. Mana, you should get along with Kenta. He's the funniest guy at Mirako!"
    KENTA: "No really, can you help me out here?"
    NATSUMI: "Yeah, easy. You don't know what to do with the furniture, so we'll have to come up with something..."
    KENTA: "That's not what I meant. And I know what do with the furniture. Takeru is sleeping on most of it. The door is the problem."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, when did you want to finish setting up your booth?"
    KENTA: "I almost forgot! Kenta I'll have to talk to you later."
    MANA: "Wait up! Hold still! Get back here!"
    Kenta walks off. Mana, still holding her singed cake, has to run to keep up.
    Natsumi gives me a weird look.
    NATSUMI: "So, about that promise... You did say you'd hang out with me and Meiko today, so - "
    TAKERU: "That took care of them though, right?"
    NATSUMI: "I feel guilty though."
    TAKERU: "Really? I didn't know that was possible for you."
    NATSUMI: "Come on Takeru, I know it's stupid early but don't be so crabby. Let's go bail them out."
    TAKERU: "Bail them out?"
    NATSUMI: "I bet I can fix this. Just you watch."
    TAKERU: "Anything so I don't have to sleep on a Kenta-made four poster bed. Let's go."
    
    Kenta must really be behind schedule. Plenty of students are milling around the gym, setting up, but I notice one or two elderly people as well. They must be early risers from Mirako, here early to check out the festival.
    I guess the gates must already be open.
    As we nagivate through the rows of booths in the gym, I'm struck by just how many of my classmates are participating. There was definitely never anything like this at Tohoku.
    TAKERU: "So how come the baseball team doesn't have a display or something set up?"
    NATSUMI: "Booo. Come on, Takeru. We weren't expecting to be here today."
    TAKERU: "Oh right. The tournament, and all."
    NATSUMI: "I'm not too hung up about it any more. It means I can at least enjoy myself today."
    NATSUMI: "Or try to, anyway. If Meiko would show up. And your crazy friends would calm down a bit."
    Natsumi points to the corner of the gym where Kenta has his cabinets set up. I spot a slightly charred cake on top of a display stand, and Mana hiding behind some shelves. Kenta is armed with a tape measure and keeps flailing his arms everywhere.
    TAKERU: "I don't know how well you know Kenta, but..."
    NATSUMI: "I know him plenty well. Watch this. Learn from the master."
    NATSUMI: "Hey Kenta!"
    KENTA: "Good morning."
    NATSUMI: "Let's take care of the furniture problem."
    KENTA: "You're here to help?"
    TAKERU: "She says that..."
    KENTA: "Oh Kenta, you're here too. Can you hold this - "
    TAKERU: "Nope."
    MANA: "Takeru! You can't be so cruel to your roommate!"
    TAKERU: "Alright Kenta. What is it this time?"
    KENTA: "The glue is setting on this one, so just push these two boards together."
    TAKERU: "Got it. How long?"
    KENTA: "Thirty three minutes."
    TAKERU: "Dammit."
    TAKERU: "Natsumi, what are you writing on that sign?"
    NATSUMI: "It's the advertising."
    MANA: "For what?"
    NATSUMI: "Our silent auction."
    TAKERU: "What? Let me see that."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you need to hold still. What's on that sign?"
    Natsumi has a big posterboard salvaged from somewhere and a permanent marker so large I can smell it even from my position in the middle of Kenta's handcrafted furniture.
    She props up the poster against a cabinet while Kenta, Mana and I all stare.
    TAKERU: "'Endou Kenta's Bespoke Woodcraftery -- Silent Auction, Today Only'"
    KENTA: "What's a silent auction?"
    MANA: "What's a bespoke?"
    NATSUMI: "Easy. Everyone comes by and sees some desks and some buzzwords. Then they put down how much they're willing to pay for each item. At the end of the day, the highest bidder wins."
    KENTA: "You're giving away my furniture!"
    NATSUMI: "Selling it. Think of it this way... You can take that cash and find a new hobby. Weren't you into taxidermy last year?"
    KENTA: "But I had to stop because the animals were too expensive... Hm..."
    TAKERU: "No more dead animals in the room, Kenta, I'm begging you. The frogs were one thing, but - "
    NATSUMI: "It's the Mirako student festival. You've got all day to find a club or a hobby or something. Take your pick. I guarantee you someone's going to buy this stuff. I'll even put my name down."
    Within a few minutes, all of Kenta's fleet of wooden constructions have a clipboard and box in front of them, courtesy of Natsumi. I guess she's craftier than I thought.
    KENTA: "I suppose this works. As much as it hurts to part with my cabinets..."
    NATSUMI: "Really it's Takeru who should be thanking be, or else he'd be sleeping under one of these desks I'd bet. You know, I'd like to see that."
    TAKERU: "Very funny."
    KENTA: "Takeru, do you want to go look around the stands? I need to find somewhere to invest my proceeds, after all."
    TAKERU: "I thought you wanted me holding this board for another ten minutes."
    KENTA: "Twelve minutes, actually."
    MANA: "I'll come!"
    TAKERU: "Weren't you hiding here from somebody?"
    MANA: "Oh! That's right! I almost forgot!"
    NATSUMI: "Who is this that you're so terrified?"
    MANA: "Y-Yumi! She's the captain of the swimming team, and if I don't have our raffle prize, she, she'll..."
    NATSUMI: "Let's see..."
    NATSUMI: "Kenta, help me carry this desk."
    KENTA: "The desk? Where are we taking the desk? You're a very presumptuous person, showing up here and bossing us around. Takeru, where do you find these friends of yours?"
    NATSUMI: "Mana, lead the way."
    MANA: "Me? Where?"
    NATSUMI: "The swim team booth."
    MANA: "But Yumi's gonna kill me! I promised a top notch prize, and now I have - "
    NATSUMI: "And now you have a custom-made 100% genuine Endou desk. It's the new top prize. Let's go."
    KENTA: "You're just giving away my desk? I'm not taking it anywhere. It's going back to the dorm."
    TAKERU: "Please no."
    NATSUMI: "Kenta, in return you get a cake."
    KENTA: "A cake?"
    MANA: "Oh! Right! It's on the cabinet there!"
    KENTA: "That's three quarters of a cake at best. I question whether this trade is - "
    NATSUMI: "Just lift the desk, Kenta."
    KENTA: "Good enough. Show me the way."
    MANA: "Over here!"
    TAKERU: "Don't mind me. I'll just hold these two planks together for another hour. See you all later."
    KENTA: "It's only eight more minutes, Takeru. Please, be precise."
    TAKERU: "Got it, got it..."

        <same as hikari_route, but Takeru starts thinking about Hagami instead>
    
    if hikari_route
        I'm left alone to man the booth while Kenta and Natsumi haul the desk. Hopefully with all her hyperventilating Mana still remembers where to lead them.
        A few of the early-comers stop by. It's tough to field questions while trying to squeeze together my two boards, but most of the visitors are just confused as to why there's a wooden bedroom set in the middle of the gym.
        Somewhere in the distance, I hear the principal on the loudspeaker. I guess that must be the opening ceremonies, but checking my watch, Kenta's boards need two more minutes of pressure. I'll stay here.
        One grandfather at least enters the auction. Hopefully this is a sign that everything will sell and I won't have to haul all the unsold prizes back to the dorm.
        And of course, whenever I spot someone I know from class, I duck behind a cabinet. No way I'm trying to explain this whole setup. As long as my classmates and the Mirako residents don't show up at the same time, I'll be fine.
        That's what I'm thinking, crouched behind Natsumi's advertisement sign, when someone taps me on the shoulder.
        
    if hikari_route or hagami_route
        TAKERU: "Gaah!"
        NATSUMI: "So what're you up to there, Takeru?"
        TAKERU: "Oh, it's just you."
        NATSUMI: "'Just' me? I'm sort of offended, but I'm in a good mood today so I'll let you off."
        I dust off my shoulder and stand up.
        NATSUMI: "Seriously though. Is everyone hiding today? You were even making fun of Mana for it."
        TAKERU: "No... I just didn't want to explain to the entire school what all the furniture's for. Because honestly I have no idea what inspired Kenta to make it in the first place."
        NATSUMI: "Then make something up. You're supposed to be the salesman! I'm thinking maybe I should be the one manning the booth."
        TAKERU: "Be my guest."
        NATSUMI: "Oh cheer up a bit. It's festival today, what're you in a mood for?"
        I'm not really sure, come to think of it. The gym's full of noise, laughter, and now the smell of the grill starting up outside... I guess I'd call it fun. It's just my mind's somewhere else.
        Hagami has her performance this afternoon. I haven't seen her yet.
        Who knows where Hikari is. "Speeches from the Student Council" is still printed in the program for the closing ceremonies, but I know there's fireworks in store, and then Hikari will...
        Something.
        Maybe I just imagined all that Hagami said last night. Under the firworks, Hikari's memory will return. She won't... vanish?
        NATSUMI: "This is Terran Base to Takeru. Alien fighters, three o'clock. Do you copy?"
        NATSUMI: "Takeru?"
        TAKERU: "Sorry, what?"
        NATSUMI: "You looked like you were having a war flashback there. Did you go to a terrible school festival as a kid?"
        TAKERU: "I'm just distracted is all."
        NATSUMI: "Hey, I'll cover on the booth. You go out there and check out the festival."
        TAKERU: "Er, thanks. No sign of Meiko then?"
        NATSUMI: "She was at the opening ceremony. Said she'd be free after lunch."
        NATSUMI: "If you see her though, you guys get right back here, okay? Drag her back if necessary. No having fun without me."
        TAKERU: "Got it."
        NATSUMI: "Oh, and see if you can find Mana and Kenta. I left them unsupervised after we dropped off the desk, and uh, your friend Mana seems like she's more likely to injure herself than even Kenta."
        TAKERU: "Kenta mostly just injures me..."
        TAKERU: "I'll try and find them. Where did they go?"
        NATSUMI: "They're still in the gym, I think. Kenta's got to find himself a new hobby, after all."
        TAKERU: "I'd better hurry up before Mana gets him hooked on voodoo. Thank goodness the supernatural club doesn't have anything set up."
        NATSUMI: "We have a supernatural club?"
        TAKERU: "You're not invited."
        NATSUMI: "Fine, fine. See you later, Takeru, and try to enjoy yourself a little."
        
    if meiko_route:
        My hands start to strain somewhere around minute five. At least that's how long I think has past. My wrist is positioned at an awkward angle where I can't even check the time. I better start counting seconds in my head before Kenta throws a fit that I went half a minute over.
        ...Ten, eleven, twelve...
        If the whole day is going to be like this, I'm going to be miserable. Babysitting Mana and Kenta is shaping up to be a full time job, and Natsumi has an amazing ability to make any problem three times as frustrating.
        And when I think of the shows later this afternoon, I'm just nervous about Hagami's performance. And the fireworks... I need to find Hikari.
        Or I'd want to find Hikari if I had any idea how to convey that news Hagami gave me last night... that there's probably nothing happy in store for her after all. Better figure out what to do about that first.
        Pretty much the only person I think I was looking forward to seeing today is Meiko, and she's nowhere to be found. I always think I want to see her, but... Somehow when she's around I'm always nervous.
        ...That's two minutes...
        Maybe if my arms fall off that'll save me from dealing with today. Although actually, if that happened, Natsumi would just use it as an excuse to lead me around by the nose.
        ...One minute, ten seconds...
        Hang on, wasn't I at two minutes before? Did I just start counting backwards?
        TAKERU: "Dammit. I've failed you Kenta."
        Somewhere in the distance, I hear the principal on the loudspeaker. I guess that must be the opening ceremonies. I have another five to ten minutes of arm pain to deal with here though.
        Some grandpa stops by and puts the first vote into the shoebox. I try to thank him, but I'm sort of stuck facing away from all of the votes boxes and I'd probably just end up falling over.
        That's when someone taps me on the shoulder.
        TAKERU: "Gaah!"
        MEIKO: "Takeru?"
        TAKERU: "Oh dammit anyway..."
        The chair I was holding in place is no longer in two pieces. It's on the floor, in six pieces, where I managed to fall over and land on it. Swift, Takeru.
        MEIKO: "Are you alright?"
        TAKERU: "Yeah. I think."
        I wish I could say the same for the chair. My dignity also took a hit. That old man who just bid is still standing there, looking like he might now be wanting to reduce his offer by a few hundred yen.
        MEIKO: "I'm really sorry. Here, let me help you get up."
        MEIKO: "I didn't mean to startle you."
        She pulls me to my feet. For a moment Meiko looks almost more out of sorts then me, but she brushes her hair back and smiles.
        MEIKO: "What are you doing back here?"
        TAKERU: "Kenta and Natsumi ran off somewhere, and now I'm stuck doing penance for not vetoing Kenta's carpentry habit when I had the chance."
        MEIKO: "How... does that involve shoeboxes? And you're aware there's a sign here for Endou Kenta's Bespoke - "
        TAKERU: "Blame Natsumi."
        MEIKO: "Alright, let's get this fixed up. I can help if you tell me what goes where."
        MEIKO: "Does this - whoops!"
        The six pieces become seven as Meiko fumbles a chair leg and a board that apparently could have used some more glue.
        TAKERU: "It's okay, I'll get it."
        MEIKO: "Listen, I'm so sorry about this, you've got to let me at least help."
        TAKERU: "It's fine. You're probably busy with all the festival stuff, and I don't want to keep you from opening ceremonies or anything."
        MEIKO: "I'll be alright. I was helping set up for the principal in the morning, but I tried to clear some time around now to see how you guys were doing. I did promise Natsumi. Although later today the afternoon program's starting up, and I have to speak at that, so..."
        Meiko frowns for a moment.
        MEIKO: "Sorry. That all must be very uninteresting to you."
        TAKERU: "Er..."
        Of course I can't think of anything actually intelligent to say.
        TAKERU: "Here, hold the end of this. I'll get the wood glue and we can try this again. It should be easier with two people.... at least when it comes to holding the thing in place."
        MEIKO: "That sounds good."
        MEIKO: "Are enjoying the festival so far?"
        TAKERU: "I'm really surprised it's so big, and there must've been a lot that's gone into organizing it all, and, er..."
        MEIKO: "You're not having a good day?"
        TAKERU: "There's too much going on today. Sorry if I'm little cranky, and I'll try not to ruin the mood."
        MEIKO: "That's alright. I understand, I guess."
        MEIKO: "There's so much bustle, and I have to pretend to be everywhere at the same time. If something goes wrong, I'm head of the student organizing committee, so they'll come to me, so I have to make sure nothing ever goes wrong..."
        MEIKO: "Then all the big clubs will be offended if I don't stop by at least once to check in, and the administration thinks I should be with the principal all day..."
        TAKERU: "You don't like your own festival?"
        MEIKO: "No, I well... I like it as an idea, I suppose. Now today it feels like I have to watch a hundred pots that'll all start boiling at once, or it's raining and I have ten buckets for twenty leaks..."
        MEIKO: "And last year, well... I don't have the best memories."
        TAKERU: "Right. That sounds kind of terrible, actually. Why'd you volunteer for this?"
        She tilts her head in confusion, as if the answer is obvious. I don't know how to respond so I just pass her the glue.
        TAKERU: "Here. Put that in the slot on your side and I'll push from my side."
        MEIKO: "I can do that."
        TAKERU: "I still don't get it though..."
        MEIKO: "What? Why I'd organize all this?"
        TAKERU: "...Yeah."
        She laughs and straightens up, looking about as dignified as one can while holding a two-by-four.
        MEIKO: "I'm our council vice president and events like this are my specialty. That's expected. Organizing is what I'm good at, and I enjoy it. You know me."
        ...You just said you didn't enjoy it. What happened to that?
        TAKERU: "...I guess I know you."
        Meiko doesn't speak for a few moments and stares at somewhere around the floor. Do I interrupt?
        MEIKO: "I don't know why it's so much harder to fool you than everyone else Takeru."
        Maybe. But I don't have the faintest idea how Meiko thinks, and I've completely misread her twice already.
        MEIKO: "Still. I'm glad today's finally here. You should cheer up a bit, Takeru. I'm sure now that you've settled in you'll find the festival's a lot of fun."
        TAKERU: "I'm sitting here repairing a wooden chair while picking up weird stares from the public. Then went Kenta gets back he's going to ask me why I let the glue set an extra two minutes."
        TAKERU: "It's looking a little bleak, Meiko."
        MEIKO: "I'll look after the auction for a while and I'm sure I can work things out with Kenta. He'll even be glad to see me."
        TAKERU: "Thanks, but you sound like you've got enough on your plate."
        MEIKO: "I'm the one that knocked over this frame anyway. I want you to enjoy your first Mirako festival."
        TAKERU: "Fine. One condition."
        MEIKO: "Alright."
        TAKERU: "You give it a shot too. Screw whatever the principal wants, you've got a promise with Natsumi and she's aggravating even when she doesn't think you've crossed her. If you're going to ask me to relax, you've got to too."
        MEIKO: "Oh, that's fine, I'm already enjoying myself."
        TAKERU: "Then... What was all that about? Earlier?"
        MEIKO: "No, it's looking up already. Do me a favor, though, and don't tell Natsumi I have two dozen other places to be today or she'll start acting strange."
        TAKERU: "Can do. She acts plenty strange already..."
        TAKERU: "Okay, all done. This just has to sit for eight minutes. Precisely. Kenta will know, I promise."
        MEIKO: "You've got it. Now go find whatever trouble he and Natsumi have got themselves into."
        TAKERU: "Right. Thanks, Meiko."
        MEIKO: "See you later."
    
    Even with the loading dock open, the side door propped, and the windows all ajar, the gym is almost stuffy. Must be all the people here today.
    It's almost hard to walk through all the aisles. There must be more visitors here than at a Tohoku home game. I guess Meiko and the others weren't exaggerating when they said the Mirako festival was famous.
    I say hello at a few whose names I barely know and try to take in the displays. Most clubs are here. The sports teams all seem to have fundraisers. And all along the far wall and spilling into the outdoors, individual students have booths set up.
    And food. The student council has that industrial grill set up, and more than a few student groups are cooking as well.
    Come to think of it, maybe it is unusual the supernatural club doesn't have anything set up. But Mana's also on the swim team, Hagami has her recital... And at Tohoku, I definitely never had to worry about funding the baseball team.
    And Hikari, of course she couldn't have anything set up. So that's why even as an official club, us supernatural members are without a -
    Wait.
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    HIKARI: "Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Wait, are you really..."
    That is her, right? Standing by one of the student display stands, two or three people pressing in?
    I think I even recognize her audience. That's not...
    MANA: "Takeru! Hey Kenta, it's Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Hey."
    KENTA: "Good afternoon, Takeru. How long did you hold the boards? Did the joint set properly? And who's manning the booth?"
    
    if hikari_route or hagami_route:
        TAKERU: "Eight minutes on the clock, the chair is fine, and I roped Natsumi into running the auction. Your furniture is safe."
        TAKERU: "She said I'm supposed to find you a new club or hobby or something. I guess you're just visiting Hikari, though."
        
    if meiko_route:
        TAKERU: "Meiko's got it covered."
        KENTA: "And the chair."
        TAKERU: "Er..."
        KENTA: "You didn't give the glue enough time to set, did you?"
        TAKERU: "I confess, Kenta. I stopped thirty seconds early."
        KENTA: "But the chair is okay?"
        TAKERU: "It immediately fell apart."
        KENTA: "This is why we have to be precise, Takeru!"
        KENTA: "I'll have to go over there and rebuild it myself."
        MANA: "You're not going anywhere! That'd be so rude!"
        HIKARI: "Oh. That's fine."
    
    TAKERU: "Er, Hikari, what exactly are... How...?"
    HIKARI: "I've always been able to come and go as I liked. This wasn't too hard to arrange."
    She gestures at the table in front of her. It's a bit of a slipshod display, just a card table. On it I recognize the newly carved chess set. There are also a few more wooden figurines, mostly rabbits with a few cats and other animals mixed in.
    TAKERU: "You're selling these?"
    HIKARI: "My carvings. It felt familiar."
    KENTA: "There was a booth like this last year."
    HIKARI: "That's probably it. I can't remember too clearly, but I know I put in the paperwork. Last year's festival, I was set up over... No, I don't know."
    HIKARI: "You, do you remember who was at that booth?"
    KENTA: "I don't remember her name."
    HIKARI: "As expected."
    TAKERU: "That's Kenta for you. Don't worry, Hikari, half the time I'm surprised he remembers my name."
    MANA: "H-Hikari?"
    HIKARI: "...What?"
    MANA: "That's your name, isn't it? I knew it!"
    HIKARI: "Of course it's my name. What did you - "
    MANA: "Hagami told me all about you! You're a Demon-rank sorceress and you have the gift of foresight, and you want to start a coven in Mirako and - "
    HIKARI: "Your friend Hagami is a notorious and mean-spirited liar."
    MANA: "Hagami would never lie to me!"
    HIKARI: "But she'd mislead you for her own amusement."
    MANA: "W-well..."
    KENTA: "I thought you were here displaying whittling and crafting. Is this some sort of black magic display?"
    MANA: "Hikari's amazing! Probably she used her psychic powers to help make her art! Right Hikari? Or was it your Taoist powers you used? I always get those confused with the - "
    HIKARI: "I used my knife powers."
    TAKERU: "Sounds dangerous."
    KENTA: "No that sounds interesting. How much does a whittling knife cost?"
    HIKARI: "I'm not really selling anything, but it's probably cheap at a hardware store. And I think I just found mine in an art class or storage room somewhere."
    KENTA: "Carving is a type of woodworking, after all..."
    KENTA: "Consider me interested."
    MANA: "You're going to learn tantric carving from Hikari? I want to learn too! I'd do anything to - "
    KENTA: "No I'm just considering learning the basics of carving."
    KENTA: "Although... That would generate a lot of wood shavings."
    HIKARI: "...I never really considered that a problem."
    KENTA: "It might inconvenience my roommate."
    TAKERU: "Are you kidding me? It's small. It's not expensive. And if you end up making something, I'm not obligated to sleep on it. Go for it, Kenta. Learn to carve."
    KENTA: "I'll consider your advice, Takeru. It all depends if the sales from the silent auction are enough to cover the knife."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, you've got two beds up there, a trophy case, that chest of drawers, a chair that I just held together for half an hour - "
    KENTA: "Thirty-eight minutes."
    TAKERU: " - and you're worried about how much a pocket knife is going to cost?"
    KENTA: "What if there are no bids? I don't want to lose money."
    TAKERU: "Mirako's senior citizens seem to be interested in your furniture so I wouldn't worry."
    KENTA: "How much is the knife then?"
    HIKARI: "Not for sale."
    KENTA: "This is a problem, Takeru. If the carving knife isn't for sale, no matter how much money the auction raises, I won't be able to - "
    TAKERU: "The hobby shop. We're going tomorrow. And we'll buy you a knife."
    KENTA: "That's very kind of you, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Tell me about it..."
    MANA: "Can I come?"
    TAKERU: "Why not?"
    KENTA: "Excuse me. Have you ever been in a hobby shop?"
    MANA: "A hobby shop? I have tons of hobbies."
    KENTA: "My apologies. You looked like a very boring person."
    MANA: "A boring person!? Are you kidding me? I'll have you know..."
    I rub my forehead as Mana and Kenta start at it again. I really can't tell if they're getting along or if they're mortal enemies.
    Hopefully they're not mortal enemies because if they start their final showdown in the middle of the festival, I'm not stepping in.
    
    if hikari_route:
        Hikari watches alongside me.
        HIKARI: "So she remembers what Hagami's told her, but doesn't remember meeting me at all."
        HIKARI: "But Hagami doesn't forget."
        TAKERU: "She's... odd."
        HIKARI: "Takeru, do you really believe her?"
        TAKERU: "About what?"
        I try my best not to show anything on my face, but I'm startled.
        Hagami hasn't told Hikari about her real suspicions, has she?
        HIKARI: "We'll see the fireworks together, and it'll all come back."
        TAKERU: "Hagami wouldn't lie."
        HIKARI: "Would you?"
        TAKERU: "Er..."
        HIKARI: "You don't have to protect me, you know. I can handle it. I've been through a lot more than you and a lot worse than this."
        HIKARI: "I can handle the truth."
        TAKERU: "I..."
        TAKERU: "Sorry, Hikari, my head hurts."
        That's not a lie. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Hagami initially told us all the lie about the fireworks restoring Hikari's memory when Mana was around, so as to not upset her.
        Mana would overreact, probably break down in tears. Then she'd forget. Then she'd break down again.
        But... Did Hagami ever really intend to hide that from Hikari? It seems cruel. Like lying to an animal before it's euthanized.
        I shudder. But I can't break that kind of news to Hikari, here, now. Maybe I'm trying to protect myself more than her.
        HIKARI: "How about we go for a walk? It's crowded in here."
        TAKERU: "You're not worried about your table?"
        HIKARI: "People steal my work all the time so it's not such a big deal. Anyway, everyone's doing it."
        True, most of the display booths are unmanned. No one would want to man a table when there's so much else to do at the festival.
        TAKERU: "Do you want to grab lunch then? I'm starving."
        HIAKRI: "I can watch you eat your lunch, if that's what you're talking about."
        TAKERU: "Right. Er... Is there someplace else you were thinking of?"
        HIKARI: "Somewhere quiet."
        We up inside, in the old wing. In my opinion, it's even stuffier in this dusty hallway than the gym, but I guess to Hikari this is what counts as comfortable.
        For a while, Hikari doesn't speak. She's frowning even more heavily than usual.
        HIKARI: "The fireworks aren't announced in the program, you know."
        TAKERU: "Yeah. It's going to be a surprise. Meiko set up everything last minute."
        HIKARI: "You're sure?"
        TAKERU: "Meiko keeps her word."
        TAKERU: "...You're actually looking forward to the fireworks show."
        HIKARI: "Of course I am. Didn't I say that?"
        TAKERU: "I guess. You've always been sort of... Er..."
        TAKERU: "Abstract."
        TAKERU: "It seems funny to me that you're actually enthusiastic about something like fireworks. When I haven't really seen you happy about anything except maybe beating me at chess."
        HIKARI: "You don't think I'm a happy, cheerful, person?"
        TAKERU: "Er, no, I mean - "
        Hikari laughs.
        HIKARI: "That's fine. I'm literally dead, it looks like. My chance at real happiness is shot, I admit. So I'll take whatever cheap thrill I can get at fireworks. Even if it's the last thing I do."
        HIKARI: "I don't really fear death because that already happened, and I've already forgot most of the people I met and knew last year... So that doesn't scare me much any more."
        HIKARI: "That's why I want to know. Even if there's nothing pleasant at the end of the tunnel, even if I'll just..."
        She's giving me a strange look. Concentrating?
        Then suddenly she breaks eye contact. Over my shoulder? There's a creak. A door opens behind us and I turn around.
        HIKARI: "I'll see you."
        TAKERU: "Hikari? Where are you..."
        She's gone before I could even look at her.
        Instead, I turn around to where Hagami is standing, looking at me from the entrance to the piano room.
        HAGAMI: "Takeru?"
        TAKERU: "Er, I was just..."
        It's hard to say I was talking to Hikari when she can vanish on a dime. Maybe I shouldn't mention that Hikari ran away...
        ...and knowing her she's probably eavesdropping somewhere.
        HAGAMI: "I thought I heard voices."
        TAKERU: "Just talking to myself , I guess."
        TAKERU: "What are you doing down here? You know the festival's going on outside. Mana's been looking for you, too."
        TAKERU: "You were practicing."
        She doesn't answer. Then again, it wasn't a question.
        HAGAMI: "Mana was worried?"
        TAKERU: "Er, I'm not sure if she mentioned it, but I know I was. We haven't seen you all day and your performance isn't too far off."
        HAGAMI: "...She knows I don't like the festival."
        TAKERU: "You don't?"
        HAGAMI: "It's loud. And... Lots of people."
        Hagami grimaces.
        TAKERU: "Oh. I guess that makes sense."
        HAGAMI: "Although... Thank you for worrying about me."
        TAKERU: "You look exhausted. Do you at least want to grab lunch or something?"
        HAGAMI: "Not really..."
        TAKERU: "Should I bring you something?"
        HAGAMI: "That... would be inconvenient."
        HAGAMI: "I'll come with you."
        TAKERU: "Right."
        
        We walk upstairs. Hopefully Hikari ran off somewhere and isn't tailing us.
        I start towards the gym, but when we get to the open double doors with the "Mirako High Student Cultural Festival" banner, she balks.
        HIKARI: "They're serving outside... Aren't they?"
        TAKERU: "Yeah."
        We take a detour to the fields behind Mirako. There are a few stalls set up here, but the main attraction is the grill I remember dragging up here a few weeks ago. The student council is running the cookout.
        There are still plenty of students milling around. Actually, it looks like mostly visitors out here. A few portable tables are set up, paper tableclothes billowing in the wind. The sound of chatter carries on the breeze.
        I notice Hagami is still a distance behind me, hesitating.
        If I think about it, I've only ever seen her outside the old wing of Mirako on a handful of occassions, and she's always seemed out of sorts, even then. Even Hikari seems to wander out more often.
        Now, with a thousand strangers filling the field, Hagami probably isn't too comfortable.
        TAKERU: "I'll grab food. Do you want to find a table?"
        HAGAMI: "Alright."
        She retreats off towards the gym entrance, at the far end of the field. Not too many people around there, I guess.
        While wait in line to pick up our lunch, I try to keep an eye out for Meiko, but no luck. Is she busy dealing with the people from the fireworks company?
        It sure looks like the whole rest of the student council is here. That bespectacled guy I always see at the meetings with Meiko serves me two skewers of beef off the grill and hands me my change.
        Hagami has her back turned as I approach the table.
        TAKERU: "Here you go."
        HAGAMI: "Ah."
        She accepts her food, but eats in silence.
        Isn't there usually a book prop to break the silence? I suddenly miss Mana. Hopefully she hasn't killed Kenta yet.
        Finally, Hagami looks up.
        HAGAMI: "Were you talking to Hikari?"
        TAKERU: "What? Back in the old wing?"
        TAKERU: "...Yeah."
        HAGAMI: "Have you told her?"
        Her question is vague, but I immediately know what she means. No, no I haven't had the guts to tell Hikari that today is probably her last day on this earth."
        TAKERU: "I couldn't do it. I don't know if I should."
        TAKERU: "Er, this sounds weird, but Hikari's really nosy. She listens in on me all the time. If she followed us, she might - "
        HAGAMI: "Doesn't matter."
        HAGAMI: "You haven't told her?"
        TAKERU: "No."
        TAKERU: "I don't know if I should."
        Hagami looks up.
        HAGAMI: "I knew it."
        TAKERU: "Knew what?"
        HAGAMI: "You really care about her."
        TAKERU: "I mean of course. She's the first person I met here. She... I don't trust anyone more than her. Of course I'm going to be upset if she forgets me, or disappears, or..."
        HAGAMI: "Is she scared?"
        TAKERU: "No."
        HAGAMI: "Are you?"
        TAKERU: "...Maybe."
        She stares, with a soft, sad smile.
        Finally, I have to look away.
        TAKERU: "Hikari better not be listening."
        TAKERU: "You think I should tell her then?"
        HAGAMI: "It's up to you."
        TAKERU: "In that opera you were talking about..."
        TAKERU: "The heroine is the ghost, right?"
        HAGAMI: "Giselle."
        TAKERU: "And the hero is engaged to her."
        HAGAMI: "Albrecht."
        TAKERU: "Does he know Giselle will disappear?"
        HAGAMI: "No."
        TAKERU: "And does Giselle know?"
        HAGAMI: "No."
        HAGAMI: "...Maybe that way is more kind."
        TAKERU: "You think?"
        HAGAMI: "I should never have said what I did."
        HAGAMI: "Sorry Takeru. I knew you... felt that way about Hikari but I've been terrible at keeping secrets, and..."
        HAGAMI: "Goodbye. I think I'd better practice."
        TAKERU: "Hagami! Hey, wait a second."
        Hagami rises from her seat, lunch half finished.
        HAGAMI: "You'll watch the recital?"
        TAKERU: "For sure. But don't you want to - "
        HAGAMI: "I'll see you then."
        She takes a few steps backwards, biting her lip. The turns and sets off on the path back around the school.
        I probably shouldn't follow.
        Instead, I sit at the empty table and stare after her. What did she mean? She asked me yesterday to tell Hikari the news, but...
        Why I am I just sitting here instead of trying to find Hikari? I know I'm the coward here. It's not indecision that has me paralyzed it's just... I don't want to believe Hagami.
        Wherever she's got her information from, it's got to be wrong. It's just an opera, right? Fiction.
        Something flickers in my peripheral vision. ...Or was that a someone?
        Hikari?
        Was she listening?
        She's followed me around before to listen in...
        No, couldn't have been her.
        I stand up.
        TAKERU: "Enough of this."
        I'll find Hikari. I'll tell her what Hagami thinks. Definitely nothing will happen. We'll watch the fireworks together, and nothing will happen...
        ...is what I want to think.
        Actually I don't want to do much thinking at all at the moment. I stretch.
        I need to find Natsumi, or Kenta, or someone. I can't sit here and argue with myself in my head forever. Instead I'll go find Kenta and argue about the price of whittling knives or something. Much better.

    I've only taken about three steps into the gym when I hear a voice.
    NATSUMI: "Yo. Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Hey! What's up?"
    Natsumi's waving and calling me over to Kenta's furniture display. One or two visitors are milling around, as well as Mana and Kenta. I join them.
    NATSUMI: "We were putting together a battle plan."
    KENTA: "You were the one putting together the plan. I don't see why we have to - "
    MANA: "Shut up and let her explain!"
    NATSUMI: "We have a team member that's MIA."
    TAKERU: "MIA?"
    KENTA: "Missing in action. It's a military term. It's usually used to refer to soldiers who've gone missing on the battlefield, so its use in this case is wholly inappropriate, and I don't think - "
    MANA: "Pipe down!"
    NATSUMI: "Meiko promised she'd be here, and it's passed lunch time, and I haven't seen her. I'll check inside the school. Mana and Kenta are searching the gym, and - "
    KENTA: "How am I supposed to know her if I see her? I never agreed to this. Why don't you - "
    NATSUMI: "And Takeru! Get yourself something to eat and check outside by the fields. If you find Meiko, report back here immediately."
    TAKERU: "I just came from lunch. And who's going to wait here at the booth?"
    NATSUMI: "That's no big deal."
    KENTA: "No big deal? I fail to see how this isn't the largest deal. I've spent hours making this furniture, and putting it at risk to find your - "
    MANA: "Finding Natsumi's friend is way more important than your dumb chairs!"
    KENTA: "You're calling my furniture unintelligent? That's nonsensical. They're all made of wood so they can't be - "
    MANA: "Come on! Shut up! Let's go!"
    Mana trudges off towards the gym entrance, dragging Kenta by the wrist. Kenta, for his part, protests the whole way, gesticulating a piece of paper that I'm sure must be his schedule.
    Once they're out of earshot, Natsumi immediately stops her military instructor impression and instead doubles over laughing.
    NATSUMI: "Look at those two!"
    TAKERU: "They apparently hate each other."
    NATSUMI: "You're kind of thick, Takeru. They're obviously made for each other."
    TAKERU: "I can't think of two people in the world that are more different. They bicker constantly."
    NATSUMI: "Oh come one. It's really funny. And you and I argue all the time but that doesn't mean - "
    TAKERU: "For one thing, we don't argue, really. I just yell at you when you do something obnoxious like try to trick me into joining your baseball team."
    NATSUMI: "Fair enough."
    TAKERU: "And second, no, we're not made for each other."
    NATSUMI: "At least humor me a bit, Takeru. Come on."
    TAKERU: "No."
    NATSUMI: "Fiiine. At least come help me look for Meiko. I bet I know where she's holed up."
    TAKERU: "Alright, I can do that."
    NATSUMI: "Ha! Got you to compromise!"
    TAKERU: "Yep, congratulations. Now where to?"
    NATSUMI: "Just outside here. I can feel it."
    TAKERU: "And you're just going to leave Kenta's booth?"
    NATSUMI: "There's only an hour or two left on the silent auction anyway. We've got plenty of bids. Let's go."
    She points towards the access door at the corner of the gym.
    TAKERU: "Right. The shrine..."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah. Are you coming or what?"
    We walk through a few aisles of stands, student displays, and tables arrayed with posters and signs for Mirako clubs. Everyone waves at Natsumi. A guy from the literature club chats her up and passes a free copy of their magazine. I mostly try to look like I know what I'm doing.
    We keep going. At this point, half the booths are emtpy. Everyone's wandering the gym, outside in the field catching a late lunch, or out by the entrance finding friends.
    I have to admit, it's a warm atmosphere. Every person she greets, Natsumi has a huge smile on her face. I can see why. She tries introducing me to a student council member, and then to a senior on the baseball team, but I can hardly remember names. I just bow and say my hellos.
    Finally, we work our way out of the gym and into the sunlight.
    NATSUMI: "Now let's see..."
    There are one or two student display booths out by this corner of the school. One looks to be the robotics club, with a poster and small RC vehicle set up on a table, the students long since left to hang out somewhere else. On the other side, a few feet away, is a shrine.
    That's... Meiko's, right? To Hikari. I was here yesterday.
    At first, it looks as empty as the rest of the tables, but then I spot movement behind it.
    NATSUMI: "Meiko? Hey! Meiko!"
    Meiko pops up from front of shrine.
    MEIKO: "Hello."
    NATSUMI: "Why's everyone hiding today? Seriously. I've been looking for you half the day."
    MEIKO: "Sorry. I needed to put the finishing touches on the shrine before the afternoon program starts. And all morning I was meeting with the company for the - "
    She looks at me. Fireworks, right? I guess Natsumi doesn't know about that yet.
    MEIKO: "There's a surprise this evening I had to set up."
    NATSUMI: "A surprise? I knew it."
    Natsumi flips open the festival pamphlet.
    NATSUMI: "Speeches from the student council, huh? No one would ever sit through something that boring. It's an obvious fake. This can only mean..."
    NATSUMI: "Fireworks!"
    Natsumi fistpumps.
    MEIKO: "You have to keep it quiet."
    NATSUMI: "I'll take it to the grave."
    NATSUMI: "What's the shrine?"
    MEIKO: "It's not much, but..."
    Meiko turns the table around to face the path. There's still no photo on Hikari's shrine, but now the pieces to her chess set are arranged on a wooden board. The knight is still missing.
    While we watch, Meiko lights two candles, then opens a clipboard on the table. The cover is a mellow blue, and the pages completely empty.
    MEIKO: "You remember Hikari?"
    NATSUMI: "Well..."
    For the first time today, Natsumi looks something less than cheerful.
    NATSUMI: "I'll leave my respects."
    She picks up the pen and scratches some words onto the page. I guess the idea is students are supposed to record their memories of Hikari. It seems a little off the beaten path for something like that.
    When Natsumi straigtens up, I walk up to the shrine to write my own message, but Meiko gives me an odd look.
    Right. I haven't met Hikari. At least as far as Meiko knows.
    ...I wonder if Hikari even remembers Meiko?
    NATSUMI: "Okay. Meiko, you're ready to go now?"
    MEIKO: "I'll probably need to duck out before the finale tonight."
    NATSUMI: "But that means you're free now. Come on!"
    MEIKO: "Alright. Let's go."
    NATSUMI: "I thought it'd be Takeru that'd be uncooperative, but turns out it was even harder to track you down."
    MEIKO: "I keep my promises."
    NATSUMI: "Good! Come on, let's head back to the displays. It's too quiet out here."
    NATSUMI: "Today's looking up, eh Takeru? We tracked down Meiko, and fireworks to boot."
    TAKERU: "I already knew about the fireworks."
    NATSUMI: "You jerk! And you didn't tell me?"
    MEIKO: "It's a secret, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "I think you all don't trust me."
    NATSUMI: "Still, it's not the Mirako school festival without fireworks. We've got a school legend to keep up."
    NATSUMI: "So Takeru, you know who you'll be watching the fireworks with?"
    TAKERU: "You guys, I guess."
    NATSUMI: "Bzzt. Wrong answer. You're supposed to watch with just me."
    TAKERU: "Oh not this again."
    MEIKO: "If you two want to find someplace private and - "
    NATSUMI: "A starless night, fireworks under the moon..."
    Meiko laughs when she sees the consternation on my face.
    NATSUMI: "I'm just pulling your leg, Takeru."
    NATSUMI: "I'm sure I'll be the one clearing out so you can get some privacy. Right? Right?"
    TAKERU: "I swear..."
    
    We finally make it back to the gym.
    Natsumi spends the time showing Meiko all the interesting displays we already saw on our first trek through.
    First stop is the swim team's booth. No sign of Mana or her senior Yumi, but we each buy a ticket for the raffle. I glare at Kenta's disk while Natsumi tries to tell Meiko about her brilliant auctioneering solutions to this morning's problem.
    Next, the food science club is selling home-made ice cream. I'm still stuffed from lunch, but apparently Meiko hasn't eaten yet.
    Finally, we come to Kenta's table. Well, multiple tables.
    MEIKO: "I see you two got everything set up."
    TAKERU: "Mostly Kenta. Trust me, I didn't volunteer."
    NATSUMI: "Hang on, I've got to see how the auction's going."
    She starts shaking the shoeboxes, set up one per item on sale. Meiko gives me a look.
    TAKERU: "She's been like this all day."
    MEIKO: "I'm pretty sure this is Natsumi's favorite day of the year. So many people here, and all of them know her."
    TAKERU: "And she's spending it with us?"
    MEIKO: "Haha. It's hard to believe, isn't it?"
    Natsumi returns.
    NATSUMI: "Not as many bids as I'd like. Didn't you guys put one in?"
    MEIKO: "I'll see what I can do."
    TAKERU: "I'd literally pay to have that stuff not in my room."
    NATSUMI: "Put in a negative bid."
    TAKERU: "How does that even work?"
    NATSUMI: "You know, if this auction doesn't meet the reserve price, you're carting all this back to the dorms."
    TAKERU: "Terrifying."
    MEIKO: "I'll put in a good bid, Takeru. Don't worry."
    TAKERU: "You're the best Meiko."
    Meiko starts to examine the furniture when I here a shout behind me.
    MANA: "Takeru! Natsumi! You've got to tell Kenta that - "
    KENTA: "Slow down. We're not supposed to be back here yet. I've already revised my schedule once today and I swear if you make me do it again I'll - "
    MANA: "He started talking to Yumi about the cake, and I was so embarassed, and - "
    KENTA: " - I'm ten minutes behind, and need to find that girl with the carvings displayed. That could take almost twenty minutes, half an hour if you're not - "
    MANA: " - then he was talking about the desk, and how Takeru put frogs on it or something, and she - "
    TAKERU: "Me? I didn't touch the frogs. Blame Kenta for the frogs. Trust me I didn't - "
    NATSUMI: "Pipe down!"
    Kenta and Mana fall silent. Then I realize I've shut up as well. How'd I get dragged into this?
    NATSUMI: "Okay. One by one, explain yourself to Natsumi. She's presiding judge here."
    MEIKO: "I'm a student council member, not a court."
    NATSUMI: "Close enough. Okay, you first."
    MANA: "M-me?"
    MEIKO: "Have we met?"
    MANA: "M-my name's Mana, from the swim team. And the supernatural club. It's my first year here. Pleased to meet you!"
    MEIKO: "You too. I'm Kotaru Meiko. I'm a member of the - "
    MANA: "Of the student council! And head of the festival committee! And you approved the supernatural club's application! Of course I know who you are! Thank you so much!"
    MEIKO: "Um, you're welcome, but really..."
    MANA: " - and everyone's always saying how kind you are, and you help out all the underclassmen, and you put together study sessions, and - "
    NATSUMI: "Calm down, calm down. State your case."
    MANA: "My what?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta was probably obnoxious. Tell us what happened."
    MANA: "Oh! That!"
    MANA: "This guy went up to Natsumi and started talking about my burnt cake!"
    MEIKO: "Your... cake?"
    MANA: "Yeah! It was so embarassing!"
    KENTA: "I don't get it. The cake was fine. I even had a piece."
    MANA: "But it was burnt you dolt! You can't put a damaged cake into a raffle."
    KENTA: "We didn't. That girl stole my desk and entered that instead."
    MANA: "But then why'd you have to tell Yumi?"
    KENTA: "It's the truth, isn't it?"
    MANA: "Not everyone needs to know that!"
    KENTA: "That's very confusing."
    NATSUMI: "Okay, I think we get it. What was this about frogs?"
    MANA: "And then he told her Takeru had all sorts of dead stuff in jars in the desk! Yumi was totally grossed out, and then she gave me this look, and - "
    TAKERU: "Not my frogs. Trust me, not my frogs."
    KENTA: "Takeru kindly volunteered space to put my collection of amphibians. He's a good roommate."
    MANA: "And you're a terrible roommate!"
    TAKERU: "He's alright. He does the laundry."
    MEIKO: "Natsumi..."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah?"
    Natsumi's sitting on top of one of Kenta's custom chairs and tapping her foot as she watches Mana and Kenta bicker.
    MEIKO: "You're enjoying this."
    NATSUMI: "It's kind of funny."
    MEIKO: "Mana..."
    MANA: "Y-yes?"
    MEIKO: "Why were you running around with Kenta in the first place?"
    MANA: "Well, um, Natsumi told to um, go and do something or toher..."
    MEIKO: "Natsumi, I find you guilty."
    NATSUMI: "What? What's that supposed to mean? Didn't you just say you're just a student council member, not some sort of Mirako special tribunal?"
    KENTA: "I would agree that Mana's been tolerable, but mostly it's been that other girl derailing my schedule."
    NATSUMI: "You remember her name then!"
    KENTA: "Of course. Why wouldn't I?"
    NATSUMI: "You've managed to forget who I am on a daily basis for a year, and you've known her for what, half a day?"
    NATSUMI: "Kind of cute, actually."
    MEIKO: "You're definitely enjoying this, Natsumi. I stand by my verdict."
    TAKERU: "There has to be some sort of punishment involved then, right?"
    MEIKO: "That seems harsh."
    NATSUMI: "Takeru's right. What'll it be, Meiko?"
    MEIKO: "Hm..."
    KENTA: "Somebody needs to help move this furniture."
    TAKERU: "Move it where?"
    KENTA: "Once someone wins it at the auction, they'll need to load it."
    MEIKO: "Alright. Natsumi, you set up this auction, so you'll help the winners move their new furniture out of the gym."
    NATSUMI: "You know I was kind of joking when I set up this whole trial..."
    TAKERU: "Sounds like justice has been served then."
    NATSUMI: "Well what if I win one of the auctions?"
    TAKERU: "Lug your prize yourself."
    MANA: "That's kind of mean, Takeru."
    MEIKO: "If that happens, Takeru, then you're help her out."
    NATSUMI: "Gotcha!"
    TAKERU: "You have to be kidding..."
    I grumble, but by now I'm just playing along. Meiko's far removed from that melancholy, nervous portrait she painted yesterday, Natsumi seems in her element, and I'm reminded of that commitment I made last night...
    If Hikari and Hagami have the courage to weather through this, my job's easy. I've been looking forward to this day for a while so I'll enjoy it the best I can.
    MANA: "Hey! That's right! It's almost time for the swim team's drawing!"
    TAKERU: "Drawing?"
    MANA: "We're pulling names for the raffle prizes soon. We want to get it all out of the way before the afternoon program starts up!"
    TAKERU: "That's all the performances and speeches, right?"
    MANA: "Yeah!"
    TAKERU: "Maybe we should finish the furniture auction before then too..."
    MANA: "That way everyone can come to Hagami's show! You should all come."
    MEIKO: "Hagami... The one that submitted that strange time request..."
    MEIKO: "I'll come."
    NATSUMI: "Meiko keeps running away so I'm not letting her out of my sight."
    MANA: "Come on and hurry up! If I'm not there for the drawing, Yumi will kill me!"
    KENTA: "Where are you dragging me? Let go of my arm. If you knew about this ahead of time, you should've let me know so I could put it on my schedule. This is unreasonable."
    NATSUMI: "Mana, lead the way. Quiet down, Kenta."
    They charge off into the sea of people. I'm about to trudge after them when I feel a hand on my shoulder.
    MEIKO: "Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "Huh?"
    Meiko withdraws her hand as I turn around.
    MEIKO: "Thanks for coming out."
    TAKERU: "Oh, me? Natsumi kind of forced me. Although I think I would've come anyway..."
    MEIKO: "It really feels like you're a part of Mirako now."
    TAKERU: "This place is er... Very different from my last school, but I've never felt like I didn't belong. Mostly thanks to you."
    MEIKO: "You flatter me."
    MEIKO: "The shrine didn't seem... strange to you?"
    TAKERU: "The shrine for Hagami? No."
    MEIKO: "And the fireworks? You never questioned that I cancelled them."
    TAKERU: "I sort of get it. You were trying to pay your respects."
    TAKERU: "It still doesn't all make sense to me, but..."
    MEIKO: "It doesn't make much sense to me either. It's something the old me would've done, the one you knew."
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    MEIKO: "Sorry. I won't get all sentimental on you today. What do you say we catch up with Natsumi?"
    TAKERU: "Sure, if you can find them."
    It's tough to navigate the crowd. I thought I saw Natsumi waving to us from somewhere down the aisle, but when I get there, all I see are a few members of the baseball team and an elderly woman from Mirako with what must be her grandchildren.
    No sign of Mana, Kenta, or Natsumi.
    TAKERU: "Wait... They definitely went this way, right?"
    MEIKO: "I couldn't tell. Where was the swim team booth set up?"
    TAKERU: "It was definitely down this row of stands. Let me just - "
    We cut through a stand with homemade manga, then dodge a group of underclassmen coming the opposite direction.
    Mana, Kenta, and Natsumi come into view. Actually, there seem to be quite a few people gathered around the swim team table.
    Kenta is reading some piece of paper in his hand. So is Meiko. Raffle tickets? Mana is busy throwing books and erasers and folded up pieces of paper out of her bookbag.
    MANA: "Takeru!"
    TAKERU: "Er, hey. What exactly is going on?"
    MANA: "Have you seen my ticket?"
    TAKERU "What?"
    MANA: "For the raffle! I could've won something and I wouldn't even know it! This is terrible!"
    Sure enough, I spot the stalward swim team captain, Yumi, standing on Kenta's desk and reading out numbers. She's looking this way.
    Well, she's probably looking at Mana, who's now emptying her pockets onto the floor and spinning in circles.
    MEIKO: "Did you leave it at Kenta's booth?"
    MANA: "No. I mean, I don't think so! Maybe I'd better check."
    MANA: "But no! Then I'd miss the numbers. Quick, someone write them down!"
    NATSUMI: "Way ahead of you. If your ticket is 17-92-12-03-09, you'd have just won a deluxe cake. Or actually you'd have won a desk. Same difference."
    KENTA: "What was the last number?"
    NATSUMI: "Nine."
    KENTA: "Good news, Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    KENTA: "We get to keep the desk."
    TAKERU: "Oh please no..."
    MANA: "Kenta! You won?"
    But now Kenta's talking to Yumi.
    KENTA: "Excuse me, miss. I believe I've won the desk you're standing on."
    MANA: "This is so exciting!"
    TAKERU: "He won his own desk, Mana. This is utterly pointless."
    KENTA: "I'm quite pleased."
    KENTA: "Takeru, after the closing ceremony meet me here and we'll get this back home."
    TAKERU: "I'm not hauling that thing for you."
    MANA: "Takeru! Stop being mean to your roommate. You said you'd help Meiko move the furniture if she won, but you won't do the same thing for Kenta?"
    NATSUMI: "It's only fair, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "I feel like I'm being picked on."
    NATSUMI: "Oh quit whining."
    MEIKO: "Natsumi, if the swim team raffle is closing, isn't it about time to wrap up the auction?"
    NATSUMI: "Sure, as soon as Kenta finishes claiming his shiny new desk."
    TAKERU: "It's his desk in the first place. All that's happened here is he's gained three quarters of a cake from - "
    NATSUMI: "Hey Kenta! How's the new desk?"
    KENTA: "I'll look forward to using it."
    TAKERU: "We don't need three desks."
    KENTA: "It's strictly better than two desks. Besides, I may want to display something on my old desk."
    MANA: "Carvings?"
    KENTA: "Or taxidermy, if that doesn't pan out. I've always wanted to - "
    TAKERU: "Kenta, I'll help you move the desk and I'll go to the hobby store with you tomorrow to pick up whittling knives."
    TAKERU: "Just no more dead animals."
    NATSUMI: "Come on, let's get back to Kenta's table. We don't have much time before the afternoon program starts up."
    MANA: "Oh! That's right! Hagami's performing!"
    KENTA: "According to my schedule, I'll be leaving in about an hour to organize - "
    MANA: "No you won't be! You've got to listen to Hagami's recital!"
    KENTA: "Who? What are you - "
    Mana snatches a sheet of paper out of Kenta's hands.
    KENTA: "What are you doing? That's my schedule! Get that marker away from it!"
    MANA: "I'm revising it! You're hanging out with us for the rest of today whether you like it or not!"
    KENTA: "You can't just decide that!"
    MANA: "Once it's on the schedule, it's official!"
    MANA: "Natsumi, how long is this going to take?"
    NATSUMI: "Twenty minutes tops."
    MANA: "Kenta, what the heck is this orange square coming up in two hours?"
    KENTA: "Oh, I need some time to sort the clothing back in our dorm. I had to take it all out of the dressers and I'm sure Takeru messed it up this morning."
    MANA: "That doesn't sound important. I'm getting rid of it."
    KENTA: "Stop vandalizing my schedule! You can't skip sorting! Move the blue block then and - "
    I start trying to shepherd them back towards Kenta's table as they continue to argue.
    Behind me, I notice Meiko glaring at Natsumi.
    MEIKO: "I was kidding before, but you really are enjoying this, aren't you?"
    NATSUMI: "I live for this."
    
    Back at the pile of jumble of tables, cabinets, and chairs that mark Kenta's booth, there's nothing of the crowd that was around the swim team's drawing.
    TAKERU: "Where is everyone?"
    NATSUMI: "It's a silent auction. No need for everyone to show up while we go through the bids. We'll just post the results and people can check it out after the fireworks."
    MEIKO: "Natsumi, you set this all up? I'm impressed."
    Natsumi is busy spelling out CLOSED on the back of the auction sign in block letters.
    NATSUMI: "You always underestimate me. I'm no lightweight. Now let me start sorting through all these..."
    She grabs the shoeboxes on top of all the items for sale and stacks them in the center of the room. She shakes the top one, producing a nice, full rattle.
    NATSUMI: "Looks like a good crop."
    KENTA: "Maybe."
    MANA: "You have to go through all those little slips? Are you sure this won't take that long? How is it until Hagami starts? I really don't want to be late!"
    It does look like most of the attendees are filing outside. There's no way there's seating out there for this many people...
    MEIKO: "Let's each tally a box then. Natsumi, here."
    NATSUMI: "Gotcha. Kenta, here's yours. Takeru, one for you too."
    TAKERU: "Thanks, I guess."
    I'm looking through what about two dozen stragers would pay for a dresser that until yesterday was holding my white socks, unfolded shirts, and whatever else happened to be associated in Kenta's mind at the time.
    Turns out the general public doesn't have a very high regard for Kenta's carpentry. Given the dresser is about the simplest design possible and put together in two days, I can't really blame them.
    That said, I'd rather have a place to keep my socks than what these people are lowballing.
    TAKERU: "500 yen? Seriously?"
    Better than having all of this junk in the dorm, I guess.
    Finally, at the bottom of the box, I find a bid with a reasonable price. Well, not that reasonable, but high enough.
    Then, unfolding the slip of paper...
    TAKERU: "Please no..."
    I turn around.
    MEIKO: "All done."
    MANA: "Natsumi! I've got a winner! You'll never believe it!"
    KENTA: "You've won this chair, Natsumi."
    MANA: "No way! You're the top bid on the cabinet too!"
    MEIKO: "Let me check the name..."
    TAKERU: "No way. They're all Natsumi."
    MEIKO: "It would seem you're correct."
    Meiko laughs while Natsumi smirks at me.
    NATSUMI: "Guess you've got some moving to do, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "The deal was I'd help you with one piece of furniture. That's it."
    NATSUMI: "That's not quite how I remember the wording. Care to clarify, Meiko?"
    MEIKO: "Sorry Takeru."
    TAKERU: "You have to be kidding me."
    MEIKO: "What can I say? I guess I'm a big fan of Kenta's work."
    KENTA: "I don't sign my work so please don't ask. It'd be uncomfortable for both of us."
    TAKERU: "Joke's on you, Natsumi. You're going to be the the one on the other end helping me lift all this all the way to the dorms."
    NATSUMI: "Hey Kenta, I'll give back the cabinet if you help Takeru move everything."
    KENTA: "Deal."
    TAKERU: "That doesn't help me at all! I still need to drag the cabinet back to our dorm!"
    KENTA: "Don't worry, Takeru. I have the measurements and the cabinet is indeed small enough to fit back through our door. Thank you for thinking ahead though."
    TAKERU: "Right, I'm putting in a bid for the cabinet. Natsumi, what did you win it for?"
    NATSUMI: "Sorry, buster. Auction's closed."
    MANA: "Good! If we don't hurry we won't get good seats! We won't be able to see Hagami!"
    KENTA: "By the schedule we should have another five minutes to work out moving arrangements. We should probably do that now or I think Takeru will be stressed about it."
    MANA: "Enough with the schedule! Come on!"
    Mana grabs Kenta again and heads for the exit. Natsumi flashes me one last smile then follows them, laughing.
    MEIKO: "Mana's half his size and still manages to pull him around..."
    I sigh and look at the furniture surrounding us. By the end of the night, I'm going to be a sweaty mess moving all of this down the hill.
    MEIKO: "If you'd like, I can help Kenta and you move all this. I need to lead the festival cleanup, of course, but afterwards - "
    TAKERU: "I'll be fine. You're probably more than busy already."
    MEIKO: "Haha. Maybe. Let's go watch your friend's recital then."
    MEIKO: "Hagami, wasn't it? That application was such a process that I'm sure it'll be excellent to finally see her perform."
    TAKERU: "Yeah... I sure hope so."
    We follow the crowd out the door.
    Mana wasn't worried, but when I met Hagami earlier today...
    I'm still worried. Did she just practice the whole festival away?
    
    if hikari_route:
        We're on the path out to the field when Meiko pauses.
        At first I'm confused then I spot where she's looking: the the side door, next to Hikari's shrine. The candles went out sometime during the day, but it looks like there are a few more notes on the open page of the book.
        TAKERU: "We should probably have a few minutes to spare if you want to..."
        I trail off. I'm really not sure what it is Meiko's got on her mind, but she walks towards the shrine.
        As I watch, she flips through the pages of the memory book. Only the first two pages have anything written at all.
        I take a step towards Meiko when I notice someone else watching the shrine. They're far off by the trees, but I can recognize her even at this distance.
        Hikari, for sure.
        I can't tell if she reacts to seeing me or not, but she's definitely looking this way. Should I run up to her? Do I shout? Meiko will probably thing I'm crazy.
        In my moment of hesitation, Meiko stands up from the notebook and I lose sight of Hikari.
        MEIKO: "Sorry about that."
        TAKERU: "No problem. Did you see..."
        Hikari's gone. I look back to Meiko but she's busy relighting the candles.
        MEIKO: "What's that?"
        TAKERU: "Nothing. Just thinking."
        MEIKO: "We'd better hurry up and find Natsumi and Kenta. Look, the piano is out on stage already."
        TAKERU: "Right. Let's get going."
    
    We make our way to the field, where about a hundred folding chairs are set up in front of a stage. Mostly everyone seated seems to be from town, while students and families are sitting in the grass all over.
    TAKERU: "Do you see them?"
    MEIKO: "Over there."
    TAKERU: "Kenta! Hey!"
    They're a few hundred feet away on a picnic blanket, but Kenta doesn't pay any attention. He's too busy arguing with Mana. Instead, Natsumi turns around and waves.
    NATSUMI: "Hey, look who showed up."
    MEIKO: "Hello again. Sorry we're late."
    NATSUMI: "Well get over here and sit down then."
    MANA: "Late? Takeru, Hagami would be so disappointed if you missed her show!"
    TAKERU: "I know, I know. When is she on?"
    MANA: "Let me check the program again."
    MANA: "Um, maybe you weren't that late. They must be running behind."
    Even though the piano is out, Hagami doesn't appear. A boy I don't know sits down at the stool instead, and a girl I recognize from class takes center stage.
    MANA: "Ah! It's Eri! You should hear her sing!"
    TAKERU: "I guess we're about to."
    We settle in for the performance. The view is actually pretty good from here. The stage is raised a couple feet off the ground, so we can see over the people sitting a few blanketlengths in front of us.
    It's a good evening for the shows. The sun has just started to go down over the hills in the backdrop, and the air humid and warm from yesterday's rain.
    At this angle, the sunlight just catches the last of the raindrops on the grass. Picturesque, although I'm grateful for the blanket.
    ...Looking closer at the blanket, it's patterned with the purple ghost mascot from Starset Sunrise, that girls' manga series. Must be Mana's. Well, at least she had the foresight to bring a blanket in the first place.
    On stage, the singer finishes and takes a bow.
    After the applause, next up should be... Hagami.
    TAKERU: "Hey, Mana. Look."
    Mana stops clapping to look where I'm pointing.
    MANA: "Hagami! Hey, Hagami! Over here!"
    Mana starts waving with ferocity, but I squint. Hagami doesn't look good. Even from this distance I can tell she's paler than Hikari at this point. Meiko whispers to me.
    MEIKO: "Is she alright?"
    TAKERU: "I hope. I know she's nervous, but everything should..."
    Go fine?
    The audience quiets as a technician pushes the piano to center stage and that student council guy with the classes comes to the microphone to read Hagami's name, and the title: "Piano Sonata No.14 'Moonlight'"
    There's another round of applause, with Mana clapping the hardest, of course. Natsumi elbows me in the ribs, and I realize I was too busy chewing my lip to clap myself.
    Finally, Hagami takes her seat. She adjusts the stool, then places a foot on the pedals.
    The noise dies.
    She's angled facing stage right, so from here, her face is almost in profile. I can't read anything. Finally, she straightens her back to begin.
    Her fingers rise.
    Two inches off the keys.
    Two seconds of silence.
    Five.
    Eight?
    She's waiting on a signal? No, there's no conductor, of course. Just Hagami framed against the twilit sky, poised.
    Twelve seconds.
    Kenta opens his mouth at twenty seconds but Natsumi pokes him. At thirty seconds, Mana looks at me, frightened.
    I can hear the murmurs now, questioning voices. After almost a minute passes, they die down. It's silent again and I hear only the wind.
    Mana's fidgeting. If she were to charge the stage, I'd hardly notice. I'm transfixed. I can't take my eyes off of Hagami's unreadable face.
    I want to look away but can't. There's a small part of that terror in me. Why am I scared? What's supposed to happen next? At two minutes? What happens at three minutes?
    I'll be frozen to this spot for an hour, Hagami one moment away from playing that piano forever.
    Her left hand shakes, not something I would have caught the movement if she hadn't been sitting there like a statue for almost four minutes now. Mana inhales. I guess she noticed it too.
    Then there's sound.
    Clapping, from Mana, beside me. It's nothing overly loud or fast or slow, just to my perception completely out of place.
    It clicks. I cup my hands together and join Mana. Meiko starts clapping a second later, then Natsumi, and slowly, painfully there's applause from the rest of the audience.
    Hagami stands up, bows, and vanishes.
    KENTA: "Avant garde music is bizarre. Classical music is boring enough as is, but I didn't understand that at all."
    NATSUMI: "Stuff it, you dope."
    KENTA: "Why did they announce that as Beethoven? Is that part of the presentation? In my opinion performance art should be clearly labeled."
    NATSUMI: "Maybe, Kenta, maybe."
    MANA: "Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Huh?"
    I'm still staring at the piano, even as the tech comes back to wheel it offstage. Mana tugs at my sleeve.
    MANA: "Come on."
    TAKERU: "Come on?"
    MANA: "We've got to go find Hagami!"
    MEIKO: "See you guys later."
    
    We pass through the rows of folding chairs, sometimes stepping over the legs of the occupants. I cut across the field at a diagonal, heading for backstage. Mana's right beside me.
    It takes a few minutes to reach the back. Hagami should be somewhere around here.
    But the only people here are the guy I saw moving the piano, a girl clutching a violin, and that student council member, perched on a stool and paging through the program. When he sees us, he gives me a suspicious glare.
    TAKERU: "Sorry... We were just looking for someone."
    He rearranges his glasses then hunches back over the program.
    MANA: "Have you seen Hagami? She just finished! When she came off stage where'd she go? Did you see if - "
    TAKERU: "I've got a guess, let's go."
    MANA: "Okay. Do you think... I hope Hagami's alright!"
    TAKERU: "Yeah."
    We take down the path to Mirako, not quite running.
    MANA: "I knew she was nervous, but, but..."
    MANA: "I thought she could do it! When we were in middle school she'd play all the time! She made it look so easy..."
    MANA: "I really hope she's okay."
    TAKERU: "Me too."
    MANA: "This way?"
    The school's empty at this point. I'm surprised the door is even unlocked. We pass one or two people in the gym all headed the opposite direction. When we enter the hall, though, there's no one. Only every other light is on.
    MANA: "She's got to be in the old wing."
    It'll take some time to cross the entire building to get there, but we keep up our pace. I only hesitate when I start wondering what I'm doing here. When we find Hagami, what exactly is it I want to say?
    Maybe I should leave this to Mana. She's known Hagami for a long time, and if we find Hagami in the library bawling her eyes out I think I'd just make things more uncomfortable for everyone. Why am I always terrible at things like this?
    MANA: "Takeru, what're you slowing down for?"
    TAKERU: "You don't think... You're her best friend and I'm just me. Maybe I should..."
    Mana stops dead and puts her index finger on my chest.
    MANA: "You're important here too."
    TAKERU: "Huh?"
    MANA: "I've known her a million years. She knows I'm going to try to cheer her up and tell her it went great no matter what. It's got to come from you."
    MANA: "Because she got up there, and she was brave. I'm proud of her. But I'm always proud of her. I want her to know it's not just me."
    TAKERU: "Right. Okay, I think I get it."
    I gulp as Mana looks up at me.
    MANA: "Sorry. She means a lot to me."
    We start moving again. The old wing is almost totally unlit now. The faint noise of the crowd out in the field is barely audible as our footsteps echo in the hall. We pass the tea room, headed for the staircase at the far end, and the library upstairs.
    Then we pass the piano room door, closed. Mana and I stop, then glance at each other. Underneath the door, a light.
    TAKERU: "Do we knock?"
    Mana just pulls it open.
    There's Hagami, of course, seated at that dusty upright piano. She turns around when she hears us enter, face blank, features expressionless.
    With a whoosh, Mana jumps towards Hagami, hugging her. There's snuffling, and I realize it's Mana that's crying. Hagami frowns.
    MANA: "H-Hagami, that was so brave, to get up where w-when I knew you were scared, I still can't believe y-you..."
    HAGAMI: "It was a bit of a disaster."
    MANA: "No, it was amazing. I d-didn't think I'd ever see you up there like that again. You're getting s-so much better."
    HAGAMI: "I made a fool of myself. Everyone's ashamed, I'm sure."
    TAKERU: "I think most people thought it was performance art."
    HAGAMI: "Really. Like that John Cage song..."
    TAKERU: "You can thank Mana. I think she sold it."
    HAGAMI: "Thank you for believing in me Mana, but..."
    MANA: "I'm proud. S-still."
    Maybe before I didn't understand. But when Hagami was up there, on the stage, I think now I recognize that terror I felt.
    Hagami hates crowds. She's uncomfortable to the point of anxiety around just a single stranger, now multiple that by the hundreds of people watching.
    Before when I thought about it, it was only stagefright. I just thought it was my first game as a starter at Tohoku all over again. That's not it.
    This is like... I could never play baseball now. I know something will happen, I'll snap backwards, I'll end up at the clinic again, maybe someplace worse.
    Hagami on that stage was me, back on the mound for Tohoku, not as my first game, but now, marching back to that spot where it all changed for me a year ago. It doesn't matter if I threw the pitch or not. Just being there is an act of defiance.
    TAKERU: "That takes some guts."
    HAGAMI: "...?"
    TAKERU: "Walking up there... I'd be too much of a coward. I didn't realize it until now. You told me you didn't think you could do it and you went up on that stage anyway."
    MANA: "Wait, y-you knew? Hagami?"
    HAGAMI: "Mana, I haven't even practiced."
    MANA: "What?"
    HAGAMI: "You know... I haven't played in years. Not for anyone else. Not alone, either."
    MANA: "What were you doing in here all that time?"
    HAGAMI: "I just... sat. And imagined them all watching."
    HAGAMI: "Couldn't do it. Even when they were all only in my head."
    MANA: "T-then how were you going to..."
    Mana sits up and wipes her nose.
    MANA: "I don't get it."
    HAGAMI: "That's alright."
    HAGAMI: "I never really need to play for everyone anyway.
    MANA: "What are you doing?"
    HAGAMI: "Have a seat."
    With the huge fireworks crate gone, there are less places to sit, but Mana finds a chair, and me, a box.
    Hagami straightens up, her fingers above the keys. She pauses.
    But the hesitation is only a second.
    It's a slower piece, with enough time for me to appreciate every note. I'm no expert, but to me, it's flawless. It's beautiful. It's enough to give me goose bumps.
    Hagami plays with her eyes closed. Her breathing is slowed, as if the instrument is controlling her and not the other way around.
    There's no sheet music. Does Hagami have this song memorized, even after years of not touching a piano?
    The sound is trancelike, effortless. I feel like the half the wonder of it is lost on me, with my total lack of musical talent, and I'm ashamed that I can only partially understand exactly what Hagami is creating before me.
    Even on this antique piano, in this dusty room, she's extraordinary.
    
    if hikari_route:
        There's quiet for a moment, then Hagami continues. The next movement? But in that second gap, my attention is broken long enough to catch a shadow by the window in the corner of the room. Is someone outside?
        No. The figure comes into focus as the music carries on. It's Hikari, of course, framed against the deep purple of the sunset outside.
        I'm not even sure she notices me - she's fixated on Hagami, frowning in concentration. Mana reamins oblivious.
        I want to call out, or at least walk over to her, but I can't interrupt Hagami. In fact, I'm not sure Hikari even notices me.
        Tearing my eyes off of her, I return my attention to Hagami, and the music.
        She's playing faster now, more delicately. How has she kept all of these complexities in her head after all these years?
        But my focus keeps slipping. I know Hikari's right there, less than twenty feet away and here I am planted on my box.
        The fireworks could start any minute. Once Hagami stops, if Hikari just fades into the background like she's done twice already today, and then... This can't be the last time I see her.
        Hagami's eyes are closed. No doubt she didn't notice Hikari's arrival. I hardly did.
        Then there's another pause, and Hagami's fingers move faster than I can follow, low to high, soft to loud, punctuated with a bang, and then repeated. Hagami is moving now, eyes open and narrowed. Sweating?
        She pauses to breathe, then goes back again. It's the most emotion I've ever seen out of her. Her attack is agressive, almost relentless, and then she fades back into a quiet vulnerability. 
        Anyone in this wing of the school could hear her now. Would they come to investigate. I wouldn't stop them. Now I understand why Mana wanted Hagami to play for an audience again. It's an experience that can't be described, only shared.
        And then in an instant, it's done. She finishes on a chord, then snaps her head up, smiling ear to ear, not in joy, but in triumph.
        MANA: "Holy cow, Hagami. That was awesome! That was amazing! I-I don't know what to - "
        HIKARI: "Bravo."
        TAKERU: "That's incredible."
        Even when we stop clapping, Hagami is still grinning. She's breathing hard.
        HAGAMI: "I forgot how much I missed..."
        HAGAMI: "I don't miss performing. I missed just... playing."
        HAGAMI: "Thank you, Mana. Takeru, Hikari... you too."
        HIKARI: "I'm just happy to listen."
        Neither of them seem too worried about Hikari's arrival out of nowhere. I glance at Hikari, but she's not looking at me.
        HAGAMI: "I forgot how it felt. Really... too long."
        MANA: "I'm so happy! This is better than the fireworks."
        HAGAMI: "Fireworks..."
        She trails off. Not unusual for Hagami, but I catch her eyes flick towards Hikari. So I'm not the only one concerned.
        HAGAMI: "I won't keep you. They'll be starting the show out there soon."
        MANA: "I'm staying here, then! Keep going, Hagami. I want to hear more."
        HAGAMI: "I'm done... Let's go."
        MANA: "You're coming? You'll come with us back to the festival? I thought you hated - "
        HAGAMI: "It's not a big deal."
        HIKARI: "Don't do it for my sake."
        HAGAMI: "No. Come on."
        But Hagami is looking at the floor, not at Hikari.
        Right. Hagami never told her, of course. That was my job, to let Hikari know that tonight is probably the end of the line...
        In my amazement at Hagami, it had almost slipped my mind. Mana, Hagami, and Hikari file out of the piano room, but as I follow, a knot tightens in my stomach.
        
    Mirako is totally silent by now. Everyone is outside at the field, waiting for the closing ceremonies.
    The secret about the fireworks might be out of the bag - the Fujiworks Pyrotechnics truck parked out front isn't exactly subtle. I doubt anyone would want to miss out if the rumors turn out to be true.
    Even in the gym, the tables are deserted. It's the same along the path to the field.
    As we pass the shrine that Meiko set up, Hikari falls back to walk beside me.
    HIKARI: "Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Hikari... Hey."
    TAKERU: "Have you been tailing me all day?"
    HIKARI: "What else was I supposed to do? It looks like you had a decent day anyway."
    TAKERU: "You know you didn't have to hide. You could've just actually wandered around with us like a normal person."
    HIKARI: "It would've made you uncomfortable."
    TAKERU: "No, er, I mean - "
    HIKARI: "It doesn't matter."
    HIKARI: "Takeru, honestly though..."
    I gulp. I knew this question was coming but now I - 
    HIKARI: "What is that?"
    TAKERU: "Wait what?"
    HIKARI: "On that table. Who stole my chess set? And the board, to boot."
    TAKERU: "Oh. That's Meiko's doing. You know that's your shrine, right? Meiko spent all of yesterday setting it up. It probably seems a little weird, but - "
    For a moment there's a panic in Hikari's eyes that I don't understand.
    HIKARI: "Very thoughtful of her..."
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    TAKERU: "You are looking forward to the fireworks, right?"
    HIKARI: "Of course."
    TAKERU: "Meiko will be there. I know you say everyone's forgottn you, but she obviously hasn't. What do you think she'll - "
    HIKARI: "I don't want to think about it. There's more on my mind."
    TAKERU: "Right."
    Probably it's the chance of imminent disappearance that's weighing her down. She has to know.
    NATSUMI: "Hey! Takeru, Mana, over here! And hey, is that Hagami? Welcome back."
    MANA: "Natsumi! Hello!"
    NATSUMI: "Took you long enough."
    KENTA: "The fireworks are about to start. You're very lucky, Takeru. Next time try to be more timely."
    TAKERU: "Where's Meiko?"
    Natsumi points to the stage as we all take our seats on the blanket.
    Meiko is up at the microphone, that student council guy with the glasses trying to plug it in. It's truly night, now. The stage spotlights illuminate the platform, but the rest of the field is shadowed. It's a good thing I remembered where we were sitting.
    NATSUMI: "The principal already spoke, so this is it. Then... Boom."
    She pantomimes an explosion with her hands.
    NATSUMI: "Takeru, Mana, you're new to the Mirako festival fireworks, so hold on to your seats. Aside from the baseball team, it's the best thing about this school. Get ready!"
    Natsumi turns around when Meiko taps on the mic, and the sound reverberates around the field.
    MEIKO: "Hello?"
    MEIKO: "Ah. Thank you all for coming out to Mirako today. My name is Kotaru Meiko, member of the student council and head of the student festival organizing committee."
    MEIKO: "To our visitors, we're glad to have you and hope you enjoyed what our school has to offer. To our students, thank you for working so hard to put this on."
    Good old Meiko, addressing hundreds of people as this were just another day in homeroom.
    MEIKO: "I hope you've all enjoyed today as much as I've enjoyed working with you all to set it up."
    MEIKO: "To wrap up the festivities we'd originally planned to say a few words this year instead of our usual Mirako tradition. That's what's printed on your programs now. To that effect I'd - "
    Something catches in her throat and for a moment I swear she's looking our way. Hikari beside me gives a little jump.
    MEIKO: "I'd like to say..."
    MEIKO: "That's much less interesting than fireworks."
    MEIKO: "Here's to a wonderful year so far and many more to come. Enjoy the show."
    Short and to the point. The crowd applauds, but I notice Meiko steps off the stage on the far side, rather than walking towards us.
    I'm soon distracted, however, by a bursting noise back in the treeline, and then overhead... The fireworks.
    An upbeat orchestral song starts playing over the speak system, but it's nothing to compete with the echoing blasts in the sky.
    At first, the designs are simple. Concentric circles, showers of stars... The fizzing orange streamers that shoot off in all directions with a satisfying crackle. Then in time with drums on the background track, four stars go off, first in yellow, then white, then violet and blue.
    It's impressive. Not so much because of the quality of the fireworks, but because of the intimacy. I can remember seeing a much bigger show at a Tanabata festival in Sendai, but that was for tens of thousands of people. This show is for Mirako only.
    Four more star shaped bursts go up, all white this time, then another row of all yellow. With each boom, the mountains beyond Mirako are illuminated by the explosion in the sky. The echo isn't only from the school behind us, but from the whole valley.
    Another firework goes off, this one in the shape of a diamond latticed with lingering bursts of red and white.
    MANA: "Wow..."
    NATSUMI: "I told you."
    I have to admit. It's breathtaking.
    TAKERU: "I can't believe they were going to cancel this..."
    TAKERU: "Hikari, what do you - "
    I turn, but...
    TAKERU: "Hikari?"
    KENTA: "Takeru, quiet down."
    TAKERU: "Where'd she... Kenta, did you see..."
    TAKERU: "Never mind."
    KENTA: "Where are you going?"
    TAKERU: "Be right back."
    
    if hikari_route:
        I wish I knew where I was going. The light from the fireworks occasionally lights my path, but the darkness is thick only a small ways from the stage.
        And more importantly, I don't where to go. I just need to find Hikari. There's no way she just went up in smoke like that, without a single word, ten seconds into something she'd looked forward to for a year.
        TAKERU: "Please let her have just run off again, please..."
        I'm jogging back towards Mirako, not really because I think Hikari might have gone this way, but more out of reflex.
        WHUNK.
        I swear my head makes a hollow sounds as I smack into a tree. Getting back up, I try to navigate by the flashes of light from the sky above, to some success. At least I manage to find the trail.
        Should I shout for her? Calling Hikari's name out here is probably just going to attract the wrong kind of attention. Will she even be listening?
        ...Is she even out here?
        The background track fades out this far from the field, and all I can hear now is the resounding boom that comes with each flash in the sky. It's the only light. Then... I see two red pinpricks in the distance.
        I jump back at first, but of course, it's not some rabid red-eyed animal. Those are lights, candles in fact... From the shrine.
        Careful to avoid tripping over and loose dirt or roots, I draw closer. One of the candles disappears for a moment, and I realize it's because someone or something moved in front of it.
        It has to be her. Hikari's there. She has to still be here.
        Only a few yards away now, I can see an outline by the candlight. With another boom, the sky is lit white and I can see her standing in front of me.
        TAKERU: "Hikari! It really is you."
        HIKARI: "You chased me all the way out here? Can't you take a hint?"
        TAKERU: "If you didn't want me wandering all over looking for you, you shouldn't have stuck around for the performance in the piano room."
        HIKARI: "I couldn't help it. Sorry. I got too attached so - "
        She's interrupted when the sky turns white and there's more thundering in the sky above. I take the moment to clos the distance to the shrine, and thankfully, she doesn't run away. Instead, she has her hands on the blue-bound book with the visitors' messages.
        TAKERU: "What are you doing out here?"
        HIKARI: "I know what's going to happen, Takeru. I overheard all of it, with you and Hagami."
        TAKERU: "I'm a coward. Saying to your face that you... That tonight you'd probably... Why'd it have to be you?"
        TAKERU: "I'm sorry.:
        HIKARI: "That's alright. When I said I wanted you to be honest with me, I really did mean it back then."
        TAKERU: "You're braver than me."
        HIKARI: "I thought I could handle it, but then, I saw Meiko, and..."
        HIKARI: "Takeru, she was my best friend. No doubt about it. And tonight I couldn't even remember where I knew her. I forget her completely, Takeru, it's all starting to slip away, and I'm terrified..."
        Hikari opens the book. Inside are a few messages from people that knew her, but Hikari flips to the very first page. By the candlelight, all I can see is a smudge of writing and the shape of Hikari's face above it. Then a flash illuminates the page.
        It's filled, top to bottom, two pages, in neat, tight handwriting that I know could only belong to Meiko.
        HIKARI: "We started here at Mirako together. We were alone, we trusted each other, and... She says I pulled her out of misery and loneliness and she wouldn't be here if I..."
        HIKARI: "I can't remember any of that and I'm afraid."
        HIKARI: "Last night I said I was fine even I just spent one last night with all of you, something to remember before I left. I'm too frightened to even do that, because, I know if..."
        HIKARI: "I'm going to forget you."
        HIKARI: "And Hagami, and Mana, and all of you that I met this year. Takeru, really, all I wanted to do was watch the fireworks with you. I was robbed of my chance for a happy ending in life, but I didn't think that was too much to ask. Guess not."
        TAKERU: "It's not too late."
        HIKARI: "It is. Hikari was right. I can feel it all slipping away now."
        TAKERU: "Not that. It's not too late to watch the fireworks... Just look up."
        As I speak, the sky is filled with crackling blue stars, then white streams of fire.
        HIKARI: "Ha. You're missing the point completely, Takeru, and I have no idea why I'm all worked up I won't remember you."
        HIKARI: "I'll take your advice though."
        The sky turns white and I can see her face next to mine, eyes skyward. As she watches the afterimages of the sparks above the trees, her expression turns from a frown into something introspective, neutral, as if gazing a hundred miles into the distance.
        HIKARI: "Then take my hand, Takeru."
        TAKERU: "What?"
        Back in the tearoom, when she admitted to being a ghost, she tried this as proof. My hand just slipped right through.
        She's making fun of me.
        HIKARI: "Just look up, watch the fireworks, and do it."
        I look upwards. A shower of purple streams shoots up, then three white stars one after the other. Like an idiot, I stick my arm out and open my hand.
        TAKERU: "Hikari..."
        HIKARI: "Just watch."
        To my amazement, I can feel something. Human warmth. Her fingers around mine. It could only be Hikari, next to me, staring up into the illuminated night sky.
        I feel each second tick past but it could never be long enough. With us both silent, the muffled music from the stage in the distance is audible, broken by the periodic bursting roar of fireworks and crackle of explosions in the sky.
        There are more streamers, then balls of white orange. With each firework, the hills and mountains around Mirako also jump into contrast with the black of the dark beyond.
        I want to turn to face her. But Hikari is transfixed, and I don't dare look straight at her.
        TAKERU: "I can see why you were looking forward to this."
        HIKARI: "It really is a beautiful world."
        Sparkling blues, then four showers of sparks, lingering white dots suspended for ages like stars...
        It must be the finally. The background track from the stage speakers is drawing to a close, and the sky is lit violet, red, violet, orange, cascading one after the other.
        Finally, the music stops. One last boom echoes around the valley and a sphere of white hangs in the air.
        It really is amazing. But if I admit to myself, it's really her by my side that holds my attention. Her presence, her warmth...
        Warmth?
        The only warmth... is my own fingers against my hand.
        Just like that day in the tearoom, I'm left holding nothing.
        When I turn, of course... There is no Hikari.
        The blue book is closed. The candles wave in the still air, a glow just bright enough to see the shrine and the orange and green chess set, still missing a lone knight.
        Missing.
        The hair on my arms raises, a response to something beyond my comprehension.
        I'm not sure if I fall over or sit, but I'm cross-legged on the ground now. The sound of the last firework keeps bounding around my skull, then settles lower, somewhere in my chest. Then it just subsides into my heartbeat.
        I know it, I just know it, that this time she hasn't just disappeared so she can listen or vanished just to screw with me. I look at my open palm. There's a finality written there, so clear to me that all I can do is screw up my eyes and sit here on this path.
        Hikari, I pray your last memory was a happy one. And I don't care if you forget me, but I'll always remember you.
        
        NATSUMI: "On the count of three. One, two..."
        NATSUMI: "Come on, Takeru, at least pretend to be paying attention. We'll be here all night at this rate."
        We're two of maybe twenty students milling around the gym, collapsing tables and taking down signs. When the festival started, I thought this place looked cheery with all the flags and posters in here, but now, half-disassembled, the place looks depressing.
        TAKERU: "Sorry. I got distracted again."
        NATSUMI: "No kidding. I think you're intentionally trying to break my back. Still mad at me for winning all this furniture, eh?"
        TAKERU: "No, that's fine..."
        NATSUMI: "Kenta and Mana will be wondering what happened to us. Unless they already managed to drop my shiny new desk and are rolling down the hill with it right now."
        TAKERU: "Maybe."
        NATSUMI drops her half of the table with a dull sound that probably disturbed some of Kenta's beloved dovetail joints.
        NATSUMI: "Okay, Takeru. First you run off during the fireworks and now you won't even laugh at my jokes. And I'm pretty damn funny, when I'm trying."
        NATSUMI: "So what's eating you?"
        TAKERU: "Not much."
        NATSUMI: "Now you're trying to be funny. Seriously, what's up?"
        TAKERU: "Do you remember the girl you met today with all the carvings displayed? Hikari?"
        NATSUMI: "No. I do remember you promising to head to the hobby shop tomorrow to buy Kenta that carving knife though. You can't be dreading an afternoon with Kenta that much."
        TAKERU: "I didn't think you'd remember..."
        NATSUMI: "Are you feeling alright? You're supposed to feel all optimistic and inspired after the Mirako fireworks, not mopey and slow."
        NATSUMI: "Did you try to confess and get rejected or something? I guess Meiko's playing hard to get. Or maybe it was - "
        TAKERU: "Oh stop kidding around."
        NATSUMI: "Man. Then it really is something serious."
        NATSUMI: "Here's the deal, Takeru. You're excused from moving my new desk, my new table, and my new set of chairs... For now. Come on back tomorrow and let's get this done. You can tell Mana and Kenta we're done for the night too."
        NATSUMI: "I don't know what your problem is but uh... You're kind of getting me down. Listen I know I've been a bit of a jerk to you once in a while but if I can help, let me know what's up."
        TAKERU: "Right."
        NATSUMI: "You're hard to crack for a guy with heartbreak written all over his face. Okay, good night, Takeru. Bring gloves tomorrow, and a maybe a back brace. We got furniture to move."
        TAKERU: "See you tomorrow."
        Natsumi waves goodbye, flashes a sheepish grin, then heads for the door. I'm left to sit on the desk and try to put anything together.
        After I managed to pull myself away from Hikari's shrine I was a bit of a wreck, but I managed to get myself back here at least.
        Hagami and Mana showed up, and I guess Hagami went home. Somehow Natsumi recruited Mana to haul back her winnings, but they're probably home at the dorms by now.
        Most of the students left in the gym now are packing up valuables, or else student council members tasked with taking down the decorations set up by the school. It's distinctly unfestive and watching the festival crumble away is just depressing.
        I can't really say I'm depressed myself. More confused. It feels like something hot keeps stinging me from back behind my stomach, but I can keep that down. My mind is racing and I just can't be bothered to deal with Natsumi.
        Students keep filtering out out of the gym. We don't have to have everything cleaned up until tomorrow, so it looks like most people are just heading home for the night.
        I wonder how many of them remember Hikari as a student. And how many remember her now, as a ghost? A ghost, or... something else? Just someone in my mind?
        My hand clenches and unclenches. I definitely felt her. She was real, and I can't forget. It was a stupid, meaningless promise and sitting here under the fluorescent lights the more I just feel like an idiot for letting her slip away.
        It felt as real and meaningful as anything, and now an hour later, I'm sitting here on a tacky desk watching people take down tacky decorations. It's all useless. That's what I think.
        Suddenly sitting around seems offensive. Doing nothing feels irreverent when I've just witnessed... Something. Enough of a something that it's idiotic for me to sit here pretending nothing important happened. I'm about to scream.
        Natsumi doesn't remember anything. Kenta and Mana are too oblivious to notice anything wrong. Hagami ran home almost as soon as the fireworks ended. Even if I wanted to explain this whole thing to someone, there's no one left that I can -
        Meiko?
        I haven't seen her... I assumed she was still out at the field, working to take down the stage, but...
        I wonder.
        
        Exiting the gym, I'm struck by a chill in the night air. I was here only an hour or two ago and everything felt so alive, but now the path is empty, the booths are gone.
        All but one. To my surprise, there are still two shadows flickering in the distance.
        For a moment it feels like someone punched me in the gut. I don't want to go back there, but there's no place left to go.
        Then I hear it. Or, I hear something. Voices? No, a single voice, saying... Saying nothing. Just a wordless, wracking breathing, somewhere between a sobbing and panting. It's an ugly noise. When I approach, it muffles and stifles. There's someone at the shrine.
        TAKERU: "Hikari?"
        ...but only for a second do I mistake that person for her. It's only Meiko standing there, gritting her teeth in the candlight.
        MEIKO: "Who... Takeru?"
        TAKERU: "Sorry. I thought - "
        MEIKO: "What on earth are you doing here?"
        TAKERU: "I... I just wondered where you were."
        It's the easiest lie I can come up with. Meiko doesn't look in any state to listen to my ravings about her former best friend who may or may not have just vanished before my eyes.
        MEIKO: "Why did you sign it?"
        TAKERU: "What?"
        MEIKO: "I put out the book for everyone to leave their memories of their time with Hikari, and... Why did you sign? You couldn't have known her. It's not possible, and I don't think..."
        MEIKO: "But you knew her name. You knew she would've loved to be here to see the fireworks..."
        TAKERU: "I'm sure she was an amazing person."
        MEIKO: "That's not the half of it. I owe her so much, and then..."
        MEIKO: "I was supposed to give her eulogy today. When we scheduled in our speeches, where the fireworks happened, that's what I wanted to do. Even when we brought back the fireworks... I was supposed to give a speech for her."
        TAKERU: "You mean where you were up there on stage today?"
        MEIKO: "That's right. Why am I even explaining this to you..."
        MEIKO: "Aside from you and me, less than ten people put there names down in this book. Why does no one care? Is it really so painful to remember Hikari that everyone just sort of drifts on?"
        MEIKO: "I wanted to speak up today, and really remember her as she was, and... I couldn't do it. No one wants to hear about her. They want to hear about fireworks, not some student that passed on without us."
        MEIKO: "Why did you convince me to bring back the fireworks in the first place..."
        TAKERU: "You know she would've loved to have seen them."
        MEIKO: "I do."
        TAKERU: "She was watching, from somewhere."
        MEIKO: "You're awfully sure of yourself."
        TAKERU: "Do you think she wanted to hear you talk about her, or do you think she wanted to enjoy the festival and everything that came with it?"
        MEIKO: "I wonder."
        Meiko pulls something out of her pocket. It takes a minute for me to identify it in the poor light, but I see it's a carved and painted piece of wood, cylindrical in shape. That's... It's the missing knight, right?
        She places it on the chessboard, forming a complete set.
        TAKERU: "You had that this whole time?"
        MEIKO: "I had to hold on to something. When you lose someone like that..."
        MEIKO: "I don't know. I felt like I needed something physical that I could hold in my hand, right here, and know she was here. Even if everyone else forgets, just that one little green knight proves she was here."
        MEIKO: "She carved this set herself, you know."
        TAKERU: "Right."
        MEIKO: "Maybe it's time I let go."
        MEIKO: "I apologize, you're about the last person I expected out here so I don't know why it's you I'm telling this to... I guess no one else in our class really notices her absence that much."
        MEIKO: "Take this."
        TAKERU: "What is it?"
        MEIKO: "A sparkler."
        I notice she has a dozen more in her left hand that she quickly stows in a bag by her side. Was she expecting more people out here at this time of night?
        MEIKO: "These really were her favorite. I hope you're right that she could see the fireworks tonight, from wherever she is."
        She strikes a match, and then with her burning sparkler, lights the one in my hand as well. The sparks burn a bright yellow-white, blinding me to everything but the two points of light in the air.
        MEIKO: "Beautiful, aren't they?"
        TAKERU: "For sure. If she can see right now..."
        MEIKO: "You know, sparklers and fireworks and all that... They're not just supposed to be pretty."
        TAKERU: "Yeah?"
        MEIKO: "They symbolize transience. Everyone and everything just passed wistfully, with enough time. There's always an ending."
        TAKERU: "Except sometimes it's too soon."
        MEIKO: "It's always too soon. I wish I could've introduced you two... That she's not standing here, right now, can only be... I don't know, some random act of divine cruelty."
        Meiko drops her sparkler. Before I can shout, she stamps on it, extinguishing the sparks shooting from the tip.
        TAKERU: "What - "
        MEIKO: "Always too soon..."
        MEIKO: "Takeru, I really appreciate that you came out tongiht and signed the book and all, but this really is something I think I have to deal with on my own. Good night."
        Just like that, she's gone. There are a few scuffles as she trudges down the path, but Meiko is gone. I'm left holding my half burned sparkler, wondering what she meant.
        It's funny. When I was a kid, I would be swinging this thing around, drawing patterns in the afterimage. Now all I can do is stare at the white point as the sparks burn into my vision.
        Another half minute passes before the sparkler completely burns out. All that remains is the metal rod gripped in my shaking hand. The illusory whiteness is still on my retinas and I've completely lost my nightvision.
        When my eyes adjust, I notice one of the shrine candles has gone out. The one remaining candle casts crazy shadows over the chessboard, each piece with its own dancing outline.
        Seeing all the pieces together there for once, without a thimble for a knight, brings me some resolution, as if even though I've made a horrible mistake, it was all destined to happen anyway.
        Bit my bit, my night vision returns. The shrine comes into focus, and the school issue table as well. I could probably follow the path back now. I'm about to turn when I see...
        Something.
        No, it has to be a someone. My heartrate doubles in two seconds flat.
        It could be no one good out here, no one natural. Appearing in the middle of the night...
        Aha. Somewhere I felt it. I knew it, I knew it beforehand, but this person is a her. Not just a her, it's her.
        TAKERU: "Hikari!"
        She frowns. Hidden in the woods, with only the candle for light, her figure is dark, but it's her. My intuition has never been this strong.
        TAKERU: "Hikari! It's you!"
        HIKARI: "I hung on."
        TAKERU: "Hey! Hikari! I'm coming over there."
        HIKARI: "Stay. I don't really... You're very vague, whoever you are."
        TAKERU: "I'm Takeru. I know you said that - "
        HIKARI: "I didn't give up. I was robbed in my time here, and... I know there was something here that I wanted to do, but the fog, I - "
        HIKARI: "You're Takeru."
        TAKERU: "Right!"
        She's off in the trees. I race off the path, but I can't seem to reach her.
        HIKARI: "I'll be back. Count on it."
        My foot catches an exposed root, and the air vacates my lungs as I slam into the ground. It's nothing. I rise to my feet, panting, but there's no one there. All I can see is the pinprick of a candle ten feet behind me.
        It doesn't matter though. I'm still giddy. I know she's back.
        Hikari is back.
        There are second chances, and Hikari is back.

label day14:
    
    I wake up and almost don't recognize the room.
    There are no pickled frogs between me and my alarm clock. There's no sign of the new cabinet and its assorted amphibian contents. Even the spare boxes are gone.
    And the strangest part: no sign of Kenta.
    Did I slip into an alternate universe last night?
    Maybe last night I started sleepwalking and wandered into someone else's room. I do live here? Right?
    I open a drawer at random. Inside, socks aren't bunched into pairs. Instead, eight identical white socks are piled up in a stack. Next to that stack, eight identical brown socks. And eight blacks after that.
    Nope, definitely home. This is definitely a dorm ruled by Kenta.
    Unfortunately, with the lord and master of the laundry gone, I'll have to hunt down my clothes today.
    But then I see a shirt and pants set out on the dresser, along with a piece of paper.
    TAKERU: "Is this a note...?
    TAKERU: "Of course not."
    It's a grid with today's date at the top and blocked out into hour chunks. It's a schedule. Looks like Kenta's penciled in some modifications.
    Lunch and every class is labeled, then time for other work, but in the morning blocks...
    TAKERU: "'Festival Preparations...' And that lunatic started at 5:00 AM?"
    TAKERU: "The school can't be open that early, he's nuts..."
    I guess this is Kenta's way of telling me where he went.
    Did he take the whole cabinet to Mirako? How'd he get it up the hill? Actually, how would he even get it out the door?
    Putting that mystery aside, I check the clock. It's still early, but there's no chance of getting back to sleep. I passed out last night, but now there's too much on my mind.
    I throw on my clothes and get ready to leave. If I'm early, I can always check what new horrors Kenta is prepping for the festival.
    It's a clear morning, and quiet.
    Unfortunately with Kenta not around, all I've got for company are my own thoughts. Mostly about Hikari.
    Last night I felt like I understood her, to a point. Why she was so closed off back then, why she seems to have such a low opinion of everyone at Mirako...
    But what did say about Mirako? It's a unique place. We're supposed to help each other out. Right? I understand that.
    What I hate is that she seems so resigned to her fate.
    Who says she's supposed to just vanish without a trace?
    That's pointless. She came back to see her friends forget her, lose all her memories of them, and then fade away with just as much disappointment as the day she died?
    Completely pointless.
    It's anger, if I had to describe it. Not at her, but at... fate?
    I'm trying to do everything I can, right? Working with Hagami every night this week...
    We'll find some way to save her. We have to.
    ...If I showed up at school today, and she was just gone, what would I do?
    I think.
    Then I realize I'm not really angry. More anxious. I'm worried I'll lose my friend.
    It's hard to imagine someone could vanish, there one day gone the next. But it's happened to her once before, hasn't it? Almost exactly a year ago today?
    TAKERU: "Wait... I'm not doing absolutely everything I can, really..."
    There are no fireworks this year. Why? No idea. But I know who's responsible.
    TAKERU: "I'll talk to Meiko. I've got to talk to Meiko."
    My stomach twists into a knot thinking about it. There's maybe three things wrong with that conversation: Meiko doesn't want to talk about last year's festival. She doesn't want to talk about this years fireworks. And I can't even tell if she wants to talk to me.
    I'll do it though. Whether Hikari's the next day or not, she'll get her wish.
    Then it won't all have been so pointless. Take that, fate.
    
    The halls at Mirako are hopping. You'd think it was an hour later than it actually is. I guess it is the eve of the festival, after all. Anything that's not set up needs to get done today or tonight.
    ...I can't spot anyone I know, though.
    And when I get to homeroom, there's no one there. Everyone here early must be outside or down at the gym. Time to head down there and see what's changed in the past few days, then.
    The place is almost unrecognizable. Half the room is dotted with chairs and folding tables, and the other half is displays of all kinds. Post are posterboards advertising clubs, but a few are more elaborate with banners and tents.
    I spot Kenta over in a corner that's suspiciously surrounded by boxes. At least I recognize that new cabinet. I'm not exactly happy to see the thing. It belongs in our room, and, after all, it did give me a black eye.
    TAKERU: "Kenta. Yo, Kenta!"
    KENTA: "Good morning, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Good morning. What exactly is going on here?"
    KENTA: "I see you got my request. Thanks for helping out."
    TAKERU: "What? Your request? No one said I was planning to give you a hand, er, even if I was, so could you - "
    KENTA: "You got the schedule, correct?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, that's not how you ask for help."
    KENTA: "Should I have asked you at 5:00 AM? I did a few times but you didn't reply. I wanted to wake you up, but something told me you wouldn't appreciate it."
    TAKERU: "Thank you, Kenta. Thank you for not getting me up at five in the morning."
    KENTA: "In return, could you hold this?"
    TAKERU: "This, er... What... What is that?"
    KENTA: "It's a piece of wood. What does it look like?"
    It is indeed a piece of wood. A two by four. It looks oddly familiar.
    I check the cabinet Kenta abducted from behind my bed, but it looks like it has all its boards in place. No suspiciously missing pieces of wood.
    TAKERU: "This... is another cabinet, isn't it?"
    KENTA: "Same structure, but my own design. I didn't have the equipment to drill the holes, so I've settled on dovetail joints. I think you'll agree it's more elegant this way."
    TAKERU: "And, er, you're holding a hand saw. That's fine."
    TAKERU: "And the other half of this board is being held by a sawhorse. That's, er..."
    TAKERU: "You must have a lot of stuff to display."
    KENTA: "I've spent a lot of time on my hobbies. It's only fitting to show off a bit at the festival. The cabinet is my first work, even if it was premade, it did get me into the whole - "
    TAKERU: "There's nothing in the cabinet, Kenta."
    KENTA: "The cabinet itself is the display."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, it's the display for what?"
    KENTA: "You have a very roundabout way of asking things Takeru. I'm demonstrating my carpentry skills."
    TAKERU: "No way, what the - "
    TAKERU: "Your what now? Carpentry?"
    KENTA: "The craft of construction. It's also an art, if you ask me. In the past few days I've become quite an - "
    TAKERU: "Fantastic. Absolutely."
    KENTA: "I'm glad you agree."
    TAKERU: "So you're just putting together a bunch of furniture? That's your display?"
    KENTA: "I've made some headway."
    Kenta gestures at the two tables I passed on my way to his corner. I noticed they were unpainted wood before, but now I see they're clearly homemade. The sawhorse too, it looks like.
    TAKERU: "I'm almost impressed. You've been at this what, a week, tops?"
    KENTA: "It seems like quite a while, doesn't it?"
    TAKERU: "At least when this is all over we won't run out of room in the dorm for frogs..."
    KENTA: "Frogs?"
    TAKERU: "Frogs. You know, you put them in jars and leave them next to my face for when I wake up in the morning?"
    KENTA: "Oh I donated all those to the Mirako biology lab. It's a bit of a childish hobby."
    TAKERU: "Right..."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, what are you doing with all this when the festival is over?"
    KENTA: "Like you said, we can never have enough space. All morning I've been thinking of new schemes. I think if we moved the winter wear to its own dresser, we'd save on average twenty seconds day compared to - "
    TAKERU: "You know what? Never mind. Tell me what I'm supposed to hold or saw or whatever. Talking is just going to hold this up."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you're a good man. You understand the value of efficiency."
    
    There's still probably half an hour until I have to be at class, but my arms are sore.
    I'm not sure I'm getting much done either. If all I'm doing is holding beams and boards steady while Kenta cuts them, I think the sawhorse is more useful than me.
    At least we're making progress. The pile of wood is now... Well, a pile of slightly smaller pieces of wood.
    TAKERU: "How do you have the patience for this?"
    KENTA: "I don't understand."
    TAKERU: "Just doing this over and over? Getting nowhere?"
    KENTA: "I do this for fun. And when I'm done we get more furniture."
    TAKERU: "I'm warning you, we're not moving my bed out to make room for all this."
    KENTA: "Fantastic idea. Next week, we can try making a bed frame. Classical style."
    TAKERU: "No. I'm not sleeping anywhere near anything you designed."
    I turn away from bickering with Kenta towards the corner of the gym. Kenta's in the back, right next to the side door. What caught my attention was the person slipping in.
    Meiko.
    She stops when she sees me. I'm not sure if I should call out to her. Go back to work with Kenta?
    Meiko doesn't look too sure either. She settles on a half smile. I guess I'll wave, when...
    KENTA: "Good morning, Meiko!"
    She shies away from Kenta's booming voice for a moment, then breaks into that composed, friendly smile.
    MEIKO: "Good morning, Kenta. How's the setup going? I'm always interested in what you have to show."
    KENTA: "Excellent. Takeru and I are displaying our carpentry and other - "
    TAKERU: "You don't need to credit me."
    KENTA: "...and it's really starting to come together."
    MEIKO: "I'm glad to hear it."
    TAKERU: "How's yours coming Meiko?"
    KENTA: "Meiko, you're putting up a display? For the student council or on your own?"
    MEIKO: "It's on my own, although... It's..."
    KENTA: "Let's see."
    MEIKO: "Well..."
    KENTA: "I don't mind if you're still setting up. I'll see tomorrow anyway."
    MEIKO: "That's right, isn't it..."
    She glances at me.
    MEIKO: "It's outside."
    KENTA: "There's display space out there? What if it rains?"
    Meiko doesn't respond and instead walks back to the door, opening it.
    KENTA: "This way then?"
    I follow.
    KENTA: "It's chilly out. Where is this?"
    Most of the clubs have booths and tents out here, so there's just as many people wandering around, moving chairs and setting up tables. Meiko, however, heads to a far corner.
    KENTA: "I didn't even know there was anything over here."
    What she leads us to is... not really a display. It looks to be built on a desk, although not the kind we have in class. Did she bring this from somewhere?
    And on it is a small shrine. For the dead? It's a wooden construction with doors that open a single hanging lantern inside.
    KENTA: "You made this? Impressive. I should probably be getting you to help me with carpentry instead of Takeru."
    MEIKO: "It's missing candles. And I don't have a good photo. I wish I could find one, or the rest of that chess set for that matter..."
    My heart skips a beat, but I remain silent. Meiko has a strange expression.
    KENTA: "Oh, it's a memorial. I assume this is for that student who died last year."
    KENTA: "I'll come by tomorrow, but I should go back to work. There's only a day left to work, after all."
    MEIKO: "Goodbye."
    Kenta wanders off back towards the gym. Meiko, however, stands by the shrine.
    TAKERU: "Then that is for Hikari."
    MEIKO: "I'm surprised you know that name."
    TAKERU: "Most days I'm surprised I know it as well."
    MEIKO: "What's that supposed to mean?"
    TAKERU: "I really don't know how to explain."
    I need to think of a way though. This might be my one chance to convince Meiko about the fireworks. I said I'd do it for Hikari, so I've got to follow through.
    Meiko doesn't quite look at me straight. I realize I'm fidgeting.
    TAKERU: "I know where the rest of the chess set is. That painted one you were looking for yesterday, that's missing the knight. This is why you wanted it, right?"
    MEIKO: "You said yesterday - "
    TAKERU: "Come on."
    I don't really want to explain why I lied to her back in the tea room the other day, either.
    We head inside, and then upstairs.
    Hopefully no one's in the team room. Luckily when I open the door, it's dark. Nobody.
    Meiko blinks as I turn on the lights.
    MEIKO: "You mean it's in this room? I forgot this place even existed. Wasn't this an office last year? I see the old library books made it in."
    TAKERU: "An office... You mean this isn't the old library?"
    MEIKO: "That's a funny name for it. It's much too small to be the library for a school like Mirako, even if the older books did end up here after the fire."
    TAKERU: "Right..."
    MEIKO: "What do you come up here for?"
    TAKERU: "Nothing much. Let me just find those pieces for you... I know Mana put them on a shelf around here somewhere after Hikari brought them up..."
    MEIKO: "What're you mumbling?"
    TAKERU: "Here."
    It's a cheap, wooden box, the type you could find anywhere, but Meiko's reaction is immmediate.
    MEIKO: "That's amazing. How did you - "
    MEIKO: "Thank you, Takeru."
    I offer her the box, but she's hesitant to take it.
    MEIKO: "I, um... Thanks. You don't think it's weird that I was, well..."
    TAKERU: "No."
    TAKERU: "I think I understand, sort of. You were her friend right?"
    MEIKO: "Um."
    MEIKO: "Something like that."
    Meiko keeps frowning. It takes her a few moments to put together an answer.
    MEIKO: "I'd put together a memorial for any student though. It's my duty to the class as a student council member. Isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "Er, I guess, but... Wouldn't the whole council sponsor it then?"
    TAKERU: "Never mind. That's not important. Right."
    I don't want to press it, but...
    TAKERU: "A week or two ago, when I asked about the fireworks... I asked why you decided not to have the display this year."
    MEIKO: "The council decided that - "
    TAKERU: "I overheard, remember?"
    MEIKO: "Ah."
    TAKERU: "Her name came up."
    MEIKO: "I explained this."
    MEIKO: "It would be disrespectful for Mirako to have a fireworks celebration this year given that the way she died, she - "
    MEIKO: "The fireworks had nothing to do with it, it's just, she just, they - "
    MEIKO: "..."
    TAKERU: "They were her favorite thing in the world, right?"
    MEIKO: "How do you know that?"
    TAKERU: "I can't really explain it. You probably wouldn't, er..."
    MEIKO: "And you knew where the chess pieces were, too."
    TAKERU: "The supernatural club meets here. I came for lunch and happened to see them, so - "
    MEIKO: "That's alright."
    MEIKO: "You don't trust me that much."
    TAKERU: "You won't tell me how you even knew Hikari. And you're the one who told me not to trust you, right?"
    MEIKO: "That was me, wasn't it?"
    MEIKO: "Strange, isn't it? Sometimes I think you're a million miles away. And then - "
    MEIKO: "I sort of miss when you talked to me every day. And you weren't self-conscious about it, you sort of..."
    TAKERU: "Trusted you?"
    MEIKO: "I guess."
    MEIKO: "You don't miss it?"
    TAKERU: "Miss..."
    I know what she's talking about. I think I do. It's not the way we were a few weeks ago, it's the way were a few years ago. Was it ever...?
    Meiko frowns. Something slips at the corner of her eyes. She turns, but when she looks back, she has one a flat half-smile.
    MEIKO: "There are no fireworks this year because they were Hikari's favorite thing in the world. You're right."
    MEIKO: "Putting on the show without her would be terrible. An insult. So I used my authority, and voila, there's no fireworks this year."
    TAKERU: "You're angry with me."
    MEIKO: "No. I'm grateful, even if you don't - "
    MEIKO: "You found me the chess pieces. She carved these, but you might already know that."
    MEIKO: "If you want to help me remember her, then help me with the shrine. And you're doing that already. So I'm grateful."
    MEIKO: "See you later, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Bye."
    She's speaking fast, uncomfortable. Then she turns to leave.
    I stand in place as she pulls open the door. And to my surprise, there's someone else outside it.
    MEIKO: "Sorry. Didn't see you there."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    I'm left facing Hagami in the doorway as Meiko disappears down the hall.
    Neither of us speaks.
    Not sure what to, I sit down. Hagami takes a few steps inside and shuts the door.
    TAKERU: "How much of that did you hear?"
    HAGAMI: "Most."
    TAKERU: "She's my friend on the student council. Er, friend might not be the right word, maybe..."
    HAGAMI: "It's not important."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    HAGAMI: "I meant I heard the part about Hikari."
    TAKERU: "Er, right. I don't know why I thought you'd be interested in all that old stuff, so..."
    HAGAMI: "I found it."
    TAKERU: "Found what?"
    HAGAMI: "Hikari."
    TAKERU: "She's not an 'it.'"
    HAGAMI: "Her nature."
    HAGAMI: "The fireworks..."
    HAGAMI: "You already know?"
    TAKERU: "Know what? Know what's wrong with Hikari? If I did I wouldn't have to be worrying about her, right? I thought..."
    TAKERU: "This sounds dumb, but she said she wanted to see the fireworks, didn't she? So I..."
    TAKERU: "I kind of got distracted talking to Meiko, but if we don't save Hikari, I just wanted to do something for her. I guess."
    HAGAMI: "That's..."
    I'm used to Hagami not finishing her sentences, but something about the way she's squinting about me makes me feel uncomfortable.
    HAGAMI: "We'll be late."
    TAKERU: "What?
    TAKERU: "Oh right, class. I'll see you at lunch?"
    HAGAMI: "We'll talk."
    TAKERU: "Yeah. Okay sounds good. I hope you have good news."
    Hagami just keeps up that inscrutable face. And then she leaves.
    I follow, but she takes a right while I make a left and head downstairs.
    Somewhere I think I made a mistake. What should the fireworks have to do with whatver Hagami knows? It's not related, is it? It's going to be a long few hours until lunch.

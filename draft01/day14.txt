label day14:
    
    I wake up and almost don't recognize the room.
    There are no pickled frogs between me and my alarm clock. There's no sign of the new cabinet and its assorted amphibian contents. Even the spare boxes are gone.
    And the strangest part: no sign of Kenta.
    Did I slip into an alternate universe last night?
    Maybe last night I started sleepwalking and wandered into someone else's room. I do live here? Right?
    I open a drawer at random. Inside, socks aren't bunched into pairs. Instead, eight identical white socks are piled up in a stack. Next to that stack, eight identical brown socks. And eight blacks after that.
    Nope, definitely home. This is definitely a dorm ruled by Kenta.
    Unfortunately, with the lord and master of the laundry gone, I'll have to hunt down my clothes today.
    But then I see a shirt and pants set out on the dresser, along with a piece of paper.
    TAKERU: "Is this a note...?
    TAKERU: "Of course not."
    It's a grid with today's date at the top and blocked out into hour chunks. It's a schedule. Looks like Kenta's penciled in some modifications.
    Lunch and every class is labeled, then time for other work, but in the morning blocks...
    TAKERU: "'Festival Preparations...' And that lunatic started at 5:00 AM?"
    TAKERU: "The school can't be open that early, he's nuts..."
    I guess this is Kenta's way of telling me where he went.
    Did he take the whole cabinet to Mirako? How'd he get it up the hill? Actually, how would he even get it out the door?
    Putting that mystery aside, I check the clock. It's still early, but there's no chance of getting back to sleep. I passed out last night, but now there's too much on my mind.
    I throw on my clothes and get ready to leave. If I'm early, I can always check what new horrors Kenta is prepping for the festival.
    It's a clear morning, and quiet.
    Unfortunately with Kenta not around, all I've got for company are my own thoughts. Mostly about Hikari.
    Last night I felt like I understood her, to a point. Why she was so closed off back then, why she seems to have such a low opinion of everyone at Mirako...
    But what did say about Mirako? It's a unique place. We're supposed to help each other out. Right? I understand that.
    What I hate is that she seems so resigned to her fate.
    Who says she's supposed to just vanish without a trace?
    That's pointless. She came back to see her friends forget her, lose all her memories of them, and then fade away with just as much disappointment as the day she died?
    Completely pointless.
    It's anger, if I had to describe it. Not at her, but at... fate?
    I'm trying to do everything I can, right? Working with Hagami every night this week...
    We'll find some way to save her. We have to.
    ...If I showed up at school today, and she was just gone, what would I do?
    I think.
    Then I realize I'm not really angry. More anxious. I'm worried I'll lose my friend.
    It's hard to imagine someone could vanish, there one day gone the next. But it's happened to her once before, hasn't it? Almost exactly a year ago today?
    TAKERU: "Wait... I'm not doing absolutely everything I can, really..."
    There are no fireworks this year. Why? No idea. But I know who's responsible.
    TAKERU: "I'll talk to Meiko. I've got to talk to Meiko."
    My stomach twists into a knot thinking about it. There's maybe three things wrong with that conversation: Meiko doesn't want to talk about last year's festival. She doesn't want to talk about this years fireworks. And I can't even tell if she wants to talk to me.
    I'll do it though. Whether Hikari's the next day or not, she'll get her wish.
    Then it won't all have been so pointless. Take that, fate.
    
    The halls at Mirako are hopping. You'd think it was an hour later than it actually is. I guess it is the eve of the festival, after all. Anything that's not set up needs to get done today or tonight.
    ...I can't spot anyone I know, though.
    And when I get to homeroom, there's no one there. Everyone here early must be outside or down at the gym. Time to head down there and see what's changed in the past few days, then.
    The place is almost unrecognizable. Half the room is dotted with chairs and folding tables, and the other half is displays of all kinds. Post are posterboards advertising clubs, but a few are more elaborate with banners and tents.
    I spot Kenta over in a corner that's suspiciously surrounded by boxes. At least I recognize that new cabinet. I'm not exactly happy to see the thing. It belongs in our room, and, after all, it did give me a black eye.
    TAKERU: "Kenta. Yo, Kenta!"
    KENTA: "Good morning, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Good morning. What exactly is going on here?"
    KENTA: "I see you got my request. Thanks for helping out."
    TAKERU: "What? Your request? No one said I was planning to give you a hand, er, even if I was, so could you - "
    KENTA: "You got the schedule, correct?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta, that's not how you ask for help."
    KENTA: "Should I have asked you at 5:00 AM? I did a few times but you didn't reply. I wanted to wake you up, but something told me you wouldn't appreciate it."
    TAKERU: "Thank you, Kenta. Thank you for not getting me up at five in the morning."
    KENTA: "In return, could you hold this?"
    TAKERU: "This, er... What... What is that?"
    KENTA: "It's a piece of wood. What does it look like?"
    It is indeed a piece of wood. A two by four. It looks oddly familiar.
    I check the cabinet Kenta abducted from behind my bed, but it looks like it has all its boards in place. No suspiciously missing pieces of wood.
    TAKERU: "This... is another cabinet, isn't it?"
    KENTA: "Same structure, but my own design. I didn't have the equipment to drill the holes, so I've settled on dovetail joints. I think you'll agree it's more elegant this way."
    TAKERU: "And, er, you're holding a hand saw. That's fine."
    TAKERU: "And the other half of this board is being held by a sawhorse. That's, er..."
    TAKERU: "You must have a lot of stuff to display."
    KENTA: "I've spent a lot of time on my hobbies. It's only fitting to show off a bit at the festival. The cabinet is my first work, even if it was premade, it did get me into the whole - "
    TAKERU: "There's nothing in the cabinet, Kenta."
    KENTA: "The cabinet itself is the display."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, it's the display for what?"
    KENTA: "You have a very roundabout way of asking things Takeru. I'm demonstrating my carpentry skills."
    TAKERU: "No way, what the - "
    TAKERU: "Your what now? Carpentry?"
    KENTA: "The craft of construction. It's also an art, if you ask me. In the past few days I've become quite an - "
    TAKERU: "Fantastic. Absolutely."
    KENTA: "I'm glad you agree."
    TAKERU: "So you're just putting together a bunch of furniture? That's your display?"
    KENTA: "I've made some headway."
    Kenta gestures at the two tables I passed on my way to his corner. I noticed they were unpainted wood before, but now I see they're clearly homemade. The sawhorse too, it looks like.
    TAKERU: "I'm almost impressed. You've been at this what, a week, tops?"
    KENTA: "It seems like quite a while, doesn't it?"
    TAKERU: "At least when this is all over we won't run out of room in the dorm for frogs..."
    KENTA: "Frogs?"
    TAKERU: "Frogs. You know, you put them in jars and leave them next to my face for when I wake up in the morning?"
    KENTA: "Oh I donated all those to the Mirako biology lab. It's a bit of a childish hobby."
    TAKERU: "Right..."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, what are you doing with all this when the festival is over?"
    KENTA: "Like you said, we can never have enough space. All morning I've been thinking of new schemes. I think if we moved the winter wear to its own dresser, we'd save on average twenty seconds day compared to - "
    TAKERU: "You know what? Never mind. Tell me what I'm supposed to hold or saw or whatever. Talking is just going to hold this up."
    KENTA: "Takeru, you're a good man. You understand the value of efficiency."

label day03b:
    
    I wake up early for once, even before Kenta.
    The room is back to its tidy self. The dressers have been moved to the center of the room and my desk migrated from my bed to the door, but Kenta's work seems to be done.
    Last night I couldn't shake that merry-go-round of wild thoughts but this morning I feel renewed. The mental burden is gone.
    Of course, I didn't dream. I never dream any more.
    It's a side effect of the pills, but I'll gladly sacrifice the dreams at night to keep at bay the dreams at day.
    Enough sitting around. I rise and yawn. Kenta's snoring so loudly I wonder if that's what woke me up in the first place.
    The first order of business is to find where my clothes ended up.
    At random I open a dresser!
    TAKERU: "Ahhhh!"
    I stumble backwards and trip over my own bed.
    KENTA: "What? What?"
    TAKERU: "Spiders! In the dresser!"
    Clutching my pillow to my chest, I approach the open drawer.
    A spider bigger than my fist sits motionless in the center, surrounded by hundreds of its eight-legged brethren.
    KENTA: "Stop! What do you think you're doing to my collection?"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    Kenta grabs the pillow from my and flings it back onto the bed.
    KENTA: "You were about to smash my Queensland whistling spider, you philistine. It's harmless. Mostly."
    Okay. There's a pin through it and it's more like the size of my palm.
    None of the other spiders seem to be moving at all either.
    Dammit Kenta.
    TAKERU: "Is this a joke? Stuffing ten million spiders into my dresser while I'm out?"
    KENTA: "No, I don't really see what's funny about it."
    TAKERU: "That makes two of us."
    KENTA: "It's my insect collection! Spiders aren't technically insects but I figure it's a niche enough hobby that the taxonomics can be overlooked."
    KENTA: "This is the beetle drawer. There weren't quite enough to fill a drawer so mantises are in here too. This one's moths and butterflies..."
    TAKERU: "Kenta."
    KENTA: "Sorry, do you not like insects? Here, I'll open the spider drawer back up, you seemed most interested in them."
    TAKERU: "Kenta."
    KENTA: "Good morning?"
    I can't even find the words.
    TAKERU: "Look, nothing against spiders, but... Just... A little warning next time, okay?"
    KENTA: "I asked if you wanted to help moving stuff in from the shop yesterday but you seemed a little out of it."
    TAKERU: "What happened to all the coins?"
    KENTA: "Had to sell them, unfortunately. They're just not very interesting. And you wouldn't believe how much they charge for those little wooden display stands."
    KENTA: "I still have some funds left over, but there's a trade show coming up in a month or so, so I'll need every penny."
    Funny, I have a penny you can borrow.
    TAKERU: "Alright, fine, you do your thing. Where can I find clothes?"
    He takes out one article of clothing after another from the other dresser.
    TAKERU: "How does everything even fit in there?"
    KENTA: "Here's your uniform. And it's a tight squeeze, even after I ironed everything."
    TAKERU: "You... ironed?"
    KENTA: "Yes. It's the first off day of the month, so I did it along with the bathroom cleaning."
    So while I wandered around Mirako, he laundered everything I own down to the last sock and also cleaned the bathroom.
    And loaded up my dresser with venomous insects.
    TAKERU: "Thanks?"
    KENTA: "You're welcome."
    TAKERU: "We should really hurry though if you want to get to homeroom on time."
    KENTA: "I get it, I get it."
    
    The walk up to Mirako is starting to seem a little less foreign. The school interior is less a maze. I find my way through the last of the morning traffic to 3B.
    I take my seat next to an emtpy desk where Natsumi should be. Meiko isn't there either.
    But then I spot her at the front of the room.
    MEIKO: "...and so with the chemistry test coming up, I'm organizing a study group. If you're interested let me know after classes today and we'll find a room."
    MEIKO: "Again, if anyone's interested in helping the student council with festival preperations, it's much appreciated."
    She takes her seat. Somehow Natsumi snuck in while I wasn't looking.
    NATSUMI: "A study group? You're crazy, Meiko. Don't you get perfect marks in chemistry anyway?"
    MEIKO: "We've got to do well as a class. Other students still need help."
    NATSUMI: "Ugh, don't rub it in."
    TAKERU: "You said the student council needed help?"
    MEIKO: "Oh it's nothing much. Just festival prep. I'll be taking care of most of it myself."
    NATSUMI: "Where do you find the time for all this..."
    TAKERU: "How much work does the student council usually do for the festival? It sounds like a big deal."
    NATSUMI: "None of 'em work as hard as Meiko, for sure..."
    MEIKO: "Oh don't flatter me. But yes, Takeru's it a pretty big deal -- the Mirako Cultural Festival."
    MEIKO: "The town of Mirako itself is pretty small so there are always people coming up to enjoy themselves and see the school first-hand. It's our one chance every year to show off what we can accomplish."
    MEIKO: "The clubs mostly organize their own events, but the student council is responsible for the school-wide stuff. And it's a week early this year, so..."
    NASTUMI: "Oh, and the fireworks are gorgeous!"
    MEIKO: "No fireworks this year."
    Natsumi makes the scariest face I think I've ever seen on her.
    MEIKO: "Anyway, most people see Mirako as this big closed-off building on a hill. We have to make a good impression. Anything less than perfect would reflect poorly on us."
    TAKERU: "Sounds like you take this pretty seriously."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah 'cause in the end it all reflects on her and the council as well."
    Meiko ignores Natsumi and her grin.
    MEIKO: "It'll be the event of the year this time around, and I'll make sure of it."
    MEIKO: "You should join a club or something, Takeru. You'd get to participate."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, I'll consider it..."
    
    I'm still considering it as I drift out of the room at the lunch break.
    Heading home early every day to deal with spiders and coins and ironed clothing just seems a little not my style.
    Baseball is off the table. Never again.
    Athletics in general seem dicey, really. Team sports just don't seem appropriate.
    I wonder if Mirako even has anything close to track and field. I'm kind of amazed they even have their own baseball diamond.
    In my wandering, I seem to have come to the old wing. I guess there's another "club" nearby...
    The supernatural does not interest me per se. Even less interesting are the books that stock the library where the pseudo-club meets. Why am I outside their door?
    Inside I hear voices. Two voices, actually.
    MANA: "It's not manga, it's a light novel!"
    NATSUMI: "A regular novel would be bad enough. If it has a number after the title, it's of no value."
    MANA: "Oh yeah? I seem to remember a lot of music being piano concerto number two or the ninth symphony or whatever."
    HAGAMI: "That's different."
    MANA: "And what kind of sequel to a novel has a number? Is there a War and Peace 2 somewhere that I don't know about?"
    Then laughter.
    But... it's the laughter of two people.
    I guess Hagami isn't a mute, she's just shy around everyone but Mana. Or maybe I'm particularly offensive.
    At any rate, they seem happy. I won't intrude and turn lunch into another silent staring contest.
    I turn to go, but...
    TAKERU: "Ow!"
    MANA: "Sorry sorry sorry!"
    The door opens into me, knocking me off balance.
    MANA: "Oh! It's Takeru! Good afternoon! Are you alright? I didn't see you there."
    TAKERU: "The door has a window you know..."
    MANA: "I know, I know..."
    MANA: "Did you come by to eat with us?"
    TAKERU: "I was headed to the roof, just passing by, but..."
    She seems more glad to see me. If I were her I think I'd find my lurking more suspicious. Maybe this isn't so bad, assuming I don't get tricked into eating with just Hagami's death glare for company.
    TAKERU: "Are you going somewhere?"
    MANA: "Uhh... Let me see... Nope!"
    TAKERU: "You just left the library for no reason?"
    MANA: "It must've been fate to run into you!"
    Run into me? I dust off my shoulder. Why does fate have to be so literal?
    MANA: "You're coming right?"
    TAKERU: "Just for a bit then."
    MANA: "Stupendous! Okay."
    MANA: "Hey Hagami! You remember Takeru right?"
    HAGAMI: "...Of course."
    She couldn't look less thrilled about.
    TAKERU: "Sorry for the intrusion. I was just walking through."
    I sit down and take out my food. Mana joins me.
    MANA: "It's fine if you come up every day, even. I understand if you're transfer. It's fine not to have too many friends in the beginning."
    MANA: "When I moved here a few years back I didn't know anybody. But Hagami was so friendly."
    It seems hard to believe. It seems Hagami agrees -- when she sees me looking at her, she shrugs.
    MANA: "You seem pretty friendly too though. I'm sure you're meeting lots of great people!"
    TAKERU: "No, I have friends, I guess..."
    Natsumi's more acquaintance than friend. Kenta could be considered a friend but at the moment I consider him a menace to my sanity. Meiko, though...
    TAKERU: "I actually ran into one of my best friends growing up. We lost touch a few years ago but I guess she goes here now."
    MANA: "Oh yeah?"
    TAKERU: "Kotaru Meiko. She's a student council member, maybe you..."
    From Mana's Scowl and Hagami's shake of the head, it looks like they already know her.
    TAKERU: "Not a friend of yours, then?"
    MANA: "Well I dunno, she's my senior and she's always so hardworking and smart, so I guess she must be a good person, but she's also..."
    HAGAMI: "By the book."
    By the book, coming from Hagami, wouldn't that be a good thing?
    MANA: "She's not too happy about the supernatural club only having two members."
    TAKERU: "Oh. I sort of thought the club was a joke."
    MANA: "It's not a joke! We do serious work here!"
    I try to read Hagami but she has a straight face.
    TAKERU: "Okay."
    MANA: "But yeah, it's nothing serious, but I guess we're not an official club really, and we don't get funding for anything..."
    TAKERU: "What do you need funding for?"
    HAGAMI: "More books."
    She's still stonefaced.
    MANA: "It'd be nice to do something for the festival..."
    TAKERU: "Oh. That's coming up, isn't it."
    MANA: "Not really. Isn't it almost two months away?"
    TAKERU: "No idea. Meiko made it sound like it was this all-consuming thing on the horizon."
    MANA: "Well of course! She probably has to do all the work to set it up!"
    Is that new Meiko? Slaving over everything, setting up a dozen different events at once?
    TAKERU: "Anyway, I'm doing alright for myself at Mirako."
    MANA: "Good to hear!"
    TAKERU: "So what exactly do you guys do at the supernatural club?"
    MANA: "It's all about the mysteries! Have you heard of Starset Sunrise?"
    TAKERU: "Is that some kind of, like... astronomical thing?"
    HAGAMI: "Pffft..."
    MANA: "What? No. See?"
    She shows me her paperback. It's not quite the same as the one from yesterday, but it has the same sky motif on the front cover.
    MANA: "I'm on volume 5 but there are 8 volumes in the arc. And if there's another run I don't know if they'll reveal the answer in the arc at all!"
    MANA: "It's a supernatural murder mystery, see?"
    HAGAMI: "Romance."
    MANA: "Well that too. But if it's a kiss with a ghost does it really count?"
    HAGAMI: "A true mystery."
    TAKERU: "Alright, slow down. You guys just read I guess?"
    MANA: "I'm gonna make a mystery of my own maybe. I've got some of the illustrations done, but it's tough going. Hagami's writing."
    Hagami's mouth is a horizontal line, but her eyes... she looks kind of alarmed.
    MANA: "...Maybe it's not something really worth presenting at the festival."
    TAKERU: "Don't look so down, I'm, er, sure it's a worthwhile project."
    MANA: "I guess Hagami does her stuff as well."
    Hagami declines to meet my gaze.
    MANA: "Show him your book."
    She just gestures at the spine. It's something foreign. "Confessio Fraternitatis?"
    HAGAMI: "It's Rosicrucian."
    TAKERU: "Could've fooled me, I thought it was Latin. I'm not sure I get it."
    MANA: "Hagami's serious about this stuff. Actual mysteries from beyond! That's why she'll make the best writer."
    TAKERU: "Right."

label day07:

    I can't sleep. 
    It has to be two hours before my alarm or Kenta would wake me up.
    While the embalmed frogs (two of them now) aren't doing me any favors, I know the real reason I can't get any rest. There's too much going on inside my head.
    There's a subtle feeling that something is fundamentally wrong.
    That Hikari is wrong.
    That I shouldn't know her name, shouldn't talk to her, and even less be able to see her every day.
    But that's not right, is it?
    I roll over in bed again. On top of the dresser, a dead frog returns my distant stare.
    Basically, the way I see it, there's only one way anything makes sense.
    My grip on reality could be even more fragile than I thought, but unless Meiko, Mana, Natsumi and the rest are lying to me in some sort of warped vendetta...
    I think I know Hikari's secret.
    I don't know why I'm allowed to know it, but I know it, and so now I can't sleep.
    TAKERU: "This is awful."
    Of course the only reply is a snore from Kenta.
    TAKERU: "Guess there's no helping it."
    With a yawn, I pull myself out from under the blanket. A hint of sun finds its way in through the window.
    By the time I've showered, eaten, and struggled through Kenta's clothing schemes to dress myself, it's still almost dark out.
    While I could stew in the dorm for another hour or so, I don't think anything will help but fresh air. And maybe some answers at Mirako.
    I'm almost out the door before I take a glance back at Kenta, still passed out on his side of the room.
    If I don't want to deal with the patented wrath of Kenta later, I'd better write him a note.
    That done, I start up the hill to Mirako.
    It's quiet compared to what I'm used to. No people. No cars in the town below. Even the wind seems to have died down today. It's chilly. And also eerie.
    TAKERU: "Kind of fitting..."
    There are one or two students around the front gate when I enter, but it's even too early for those who come here for early practices.
    Homeroom is deserted.
    I take my seat but I feel like an idiot. Nobody will be here for another hour at least.
    Maybe I should've just stayed outside and wandered around a bit, but there's something strange in the air and my mind is blank. This isn't happening.
    What I really want to do is talk this over with someone, but there's no guarantee anyone will have any idea what I'm talking about. And it's not like anyone's around anyway.
    Well... Except for the girl in question herself.
    
    The old wing is familiar by this point, and it's almost indistinguishable from normal. Most people avoid this hallway if they can.
    Everyone except for her, of course.
    I slide open the door to an even more shadowy tearoom than normal. With only the sunrise filtered through the curtains, the atmosphere is suitably supernatural.
    TAKERU: "Hikari. Are you here?"
    HIKARI: "I usually am."
    I almost missed her, sitting in front of an open book, crosslegged, perfect posture.
    HIKARI: "Good morning. You're here early. Not that I mind too much."
    TAKERU: "I hope I didn't interrupt anything important."
    HIKARI: "No."
    TAKERU: "I woke up at some awful hour and couldn't get back to sleep. So... now I'm here."
    TAKERU: "There's just a lot on my mind."
    HIKARI: "Some tea might help."
    TAKERU: "That seems to be your solution for a lot of things."
    HIKARI: "It usually is."
    TAKERU: "Fair enough."
    By the time I have the tea boiling, more light reaches into the room. The chessboard remains untouched from yesterday. Each piece casts a faint shadow.
    Hikari accepts her tea wordlessly, still focused on her book.
    Trying to calm myself now, I sit down.
    TAKERU: "What're you reading?"
    HIKARI: "Just some folktales. It's a collection, nothing much."
    TAKERU: "Right."
    HIKARI: "Are you here to work through yesterday's game? With a bit more attention, and if you escape the trap, you should have a pretty good position. How about it?"
    TAKERU: "Maybe not. There's something else."
    TAKERU: "I heard something strange from Meiko. Do you know her?"
    The pause before she answers is too long.
    HIKARI: "Yes."
    TAKERU: "She said..."
    TAKERU: "Last year's festival, there was some sort of accident. A fire."
    HIKARI: "..."
    HIKARI: "Maybe we should talk about something else."
    I've seen Hikari distant, I've seen her bitter, and once in a while with warmth in her eyes. But never fearful. Her pupils dilate.
    TAKERU: "Sorry, I just need someone to clear this up. I was up all night and I think I'm going crazy."
    TAKERU: "She said someone died. A student, called Hikari."
    TAKERU: "That... Was that you?"
    TAKERU: "You, you aren't here, right? Like, you're here, but, you're..."
    TAKERU: "Was it you that died that day?"
    I expect her to call me crazy. Either that or vanish on the spot. When neither happens, I start thinking I'll probably wake up back in the clinic and it'll be April. Or I've been sleepwalking and Kenta will punch me in the forehead right about now.
    Instead Hikari seems lost in her tea.
    HIKARI: "Why don't we go back to chess."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    HIKARI: "You go over your next move. I'll... take some time and think of mine."
    I think my heartrate is too high to concentrate on the board, but if she wants, I'll give it a try.
    Even after a minute of thinking over my position, I can still feel the adrenaline.
    What's she thinking about? Why am I so nervous?
    At least the game is a distraction. The trap isn't all that hard to spot. As long as I don't make the wrong choice, my king won't end up cornered. There's a clear way out.
    Is it the same for Hikari? Have I inadvertently threatened her?
    HIKARI: "Okay."
    TAKERU: "You're ready?"
    HIKARI: "Do you trust me?"
    TAKERU: "I'm not sure."
    I try for honesty.
    TAKERU: "Something is lying to me. Either it's you, Meiko and Natsumi, or else it's my brain lying to me."
    TAKERU: "I really want to trust you. I want to give it a shot."
    HIKARI: "Take my hand then."
    Same as last time she holds it out over the board. Horizontal, not like a handshake, palm up.
    This time though, she doesn't withdraw.
    I hold her hand.
    It's cold.
    Not cold like I've grabbed a handful of snow, but cool, like I've grabbed a handful of nothing.
    Then... I realize I have grabbed nothing. There is nothing between my fingers. Hikari's eyes are closed, her hand outstretched, but I cannot touch her and she is somewhere else entirely.
    She is not of this world.
    HIKARI: "You see how it is, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "I-I don't understand."
    HIKARI: "You might've missed some details but you understood before you even came in."
    HIKARI: "It was me that died that day, most likely."
    HIKARI: "Don't ask why I'm still here."
    She chokes on air.
    She strikes me now as more distant, more alien than ever before.
    HIKARI: "Why don't you make your move?"
    TAKERU: "There. I'm moving the king this time. Done."
    HIKARI: "Hikari died from complications from a fire at Mirako's annual festival. And I'm Hikari, stuck here now."
    HIKARI: "Your friend Mana would call me a ghost, right?"
    HIKARI: "Bishop. B3."
    TAKERU: "Done."
    HIKARI: "I'm not sure how much anyone else can see me. All the other students remember who I was as a student, to some extent. They talk to me. They go through the motions."
    HIKARI: "Then the next day it's as if I never existed and I vanished almost a year ago."
    HIKARI: "Since you've come to Mirako, you've met what, how many people? Friendly people, right?"
    TAKERU: "That's right. And it's your move."
    HIKARI: "Building relationships with other people is what it means to be alive. I guess I really must be dead because I can't even do that. I have a day, even less, and then it's all reset to zero."
    TAKERU: "Then how are we talking now?"
    HIKARI: "One of life's mysteries I guess. Maybe you'll find the answer if you go walking around with robes and incense, but I don't think so."
    HIKARI: "You never knew me in life, and you said you had... some condition."
    TAKERU: "Schizophrenia."
    HIKARI: "That does make things complicated."
    She thinks for a moment. I'm about to reply when she gestures at the board for me to move a piece.
    HIKARI: "Do you believe me?"
    TAKERU: "I do."
    HIKARI: "You believe that I'm here, now, and you're talking to me, and not something you're imagining inside your head?"
    TAKERU: "I do."
    HIKARI: "I'm relieved. I really am. You can't imagine how much it means."
    Hikari stands up and stretches, beaming. I think it's the most expressive movement I've ever seen out of her.
    HIKARI: "Ever since you came back that second day I've been terrified you'd forget. You'd forget, or you'd never come back."
    HIKARI: "Now..."
    She sits back down and breathes in.
    HIKARI: "I don't want to impose on you. If that was overwhelming I'm sorry."
    TAKERU: "That's fine. I mean, I'm overwhelmed, but, you shouldn't be sorry."
    HIKARI: "No, I mean, for me, I've been stuck in a circle for year, and then... you, for you I'm one person, if you see."
    HIKARI: "Never mind. That doesn't matter now. What matters now is you know the truth."
    The strangest truth I've heard, but I've committed to believing it. There's no turning back.
    TAKERU: "Thanks for being honest with me. I'm still trying to piece some things together, but..."
    TAKERU: "At least I know I'm not going crazy."
    HIKARI: "We can only hope."
    HIKARI: "It's your move, by the way."
    I look down at the board.
    TAKERU: "Well... I don't have any moves left."
    HIKARI: "You..."
    TAKERU: "That should mean..."
    HIKARI: "It's a draw. Well done."
    While I can't come close to actually winning anything, at least I've managed to eke out something that's not a loss by hiding in a corner. It's the first time yet I haven't lost horribly to Hikari.
    TAKERU: "I guess it's a start."
    HIKARI: "Everything has to start somewhere, right? This is a good beginning. It's worth building on."
    HIKARI: "I can't force you to do anything, but, if you could keep visiting here, even only a bit..."
    TAKERU: "I'm pretty sure I'm down here daily anyway."
    HIKARI: "While you've seen it means a lot to me."
    TAKERU: "Do you ever leave the tearoom?"
    HIKARI: "You've seen me around. I go where I want, but it seems that I only ever want to be here. It's quiet. Nobody's ever here."
    HIKARI: "Maybe I'll make an effort."
    TAKERU: "An effort?"
    HIKARI: "Forget it, it's not important right now."
    HIKARI: "Don't you have class?"
    TAKERU: "Ah, dammit, almost forgot. I don't want to run, but..."
    HIKARI: "I'll see you later, I hope."
    TAKERU: "I'll be back. Have a little faith in me."
    She walks me to the door.
    I leave with almost as many questions as when I entered, but...
    Somehow things seem more orderly. Or have at least taken a step in that direction.

label day07:

    I can't sleep. 
    It has to be two hours before my alarm or Kenta would wake me up.
    While the embalmed frogs (two of them now) aren't doing me any favors, I know the real reason I can't get any rest. There's too much going on inside my head.
    There's a subtle feeling that something is fundamentally wrong.
    That Hikari is wrong.
    That I shouldn't know her name, shouldn't talk to her, and even less be able to see her every day.
    But that's not right, is it?
    I roll over in bed again. On top of the dresser, a dead frog returns my distant stare.
    Basically, the way I see it, there's only one way anything makes sense.
    My grip on reality could be even more fragile than I thought, but unless Meiko, Mana, Natsumi and the rest are lying to me in some sort of warped vendetta...
    I think I know Hikari's secret.
    I don't know why I'm allowed to know it, but I know it, and so now I can't sleep.
    TAKERU: "This is awful."
    Of course the only reply is a snore from Kenta.
    TAKERU: "Guess there's no helping it."
    With a yawn, I pull myself out from under the blanket. A hint of sun finds its way in through the window.
    By the time I've showered, eaten, and struggled through Kenta's clothing schemes to dress myself, it's still almost dark out.
    While I could stew in the dorm for another hour or so, I don't think anything will help but fresh air. And maybe some answers at Mirako.
    I'm almost out the door before I take a glance back at Kenta, still passed out on his side of the room.
    If I don't want to deal with the patented wrath of Kenta later, I'd better write him a note.
    That done, I start up the hill to Mirako.
    It's quiet compared to what I'm used to. No people. No cars in the town below. Even the wind seems to have died down today. It's chilly. And also eerie.
    TAKERU: "Kind of fitting..."
    There are one or two students around the front gate when I enter, but it's even too early for those who come here for early practices.
    Homeroom is deserted.
    I take my seat but I feel like an idiot. Nobody will be here for another hour at least.
    Maybe I should've just stayed outside and wandered around a bit, but there's something strange in the air and my mind is blank. This isn't happening.
    What I really want to do is talk this over with someone, but there's no guarantee anyone will have any idea what I'm talking about. And it's not like anyone's around anyway.
    Well... Except for the girl in question herself.
    
    The old wing is familiar by this point, and it's almost indistinguishable from normal. Most people avoid this hallway if they can.
    Everyone except for her, of course.
    I slide open the door to an even more shadowy tearoom than normal. With only the sunrise filtered through the curtains, the atmosphere is suitably supernatural.
    TAKERU: "Hikari. Are you here?"
    HIKARI: "I usually am."
    I almost missed her, sitting in front of an open book, crosslegged, perfect posture.
    HIKARI: "Good morning. You're here early. Not that I mind too much."
    TAKERU: "I hope I didn't interrupt anything important."
    HIKARI: "No."
    TAKERU: "I woke up at some awful hour and couldn't get back to sleep. So... now I'm here."
    TAKERU: "There's just a lot on my mind."
    HIKARI: "Some tea might help."
    TAKERU: "That seems to be your solution for a lot of things."
    HIKARI: "It usually is."
    TAKERU: "Fair enough."
    By the time I have the tea boiling, more light reaches into the room. The chessboard remains untouched from yesterday. Each piece casts a faint shadow.
    Hikari accepts her tea wordlessly, still focused on her book.
    Trying to calm myself now, I sit down.
    TAKERU: "What're you reading?"
    HIKARI: "Just some folktales. It's a collection, nothing much."
    TAKERU: "Right."
    HIKARI: "Are you here to work through yesterday's game? With a bit more attention, and if you escape the trap, you should have a pretty good position. How about it?"
    TAKERU: "Maybe not. There's something else."
    TAKERU: "I heard something strange from Meiko. Do you know her?"
    The pause before she answers is too long.
    HIKARI: "Yes."
    TAKERU: "She said..."
    TAKERU: "Last year's festival, there was some sort of accident. A fire."
    HIKARI: "..."
    HIKARI: "Maybe we should talk about something else."
    I've seen Hikari distant, I've seen her bitter, and once in a while with warmth in her eyes. But never fearful. Her pupils dilate.
    TAKERU: "Sorry, I just need someone to clear this up. I was up all night and I think I'm going crazy."
    TAKERU: "She said someone died. A student, called Hikari."
    TAKERU: "That... Was that you?"
    TAKERU: "You, you aren't here, right? Like, you're here, but, you're..."
    TAKERU: "Was it you that died that day?"
    I expect her to call me crazy. Either that or vanish on the spot. When neither happens, I start thinking I'll probably wake up back in the clinic and it'll be April. Or I've been sleepwalking and Kenta will punch me in the forehead right about now.
    Instead Hikari seems lost in her tea.
    HIKARI: "Why don't we go back to chess."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    HIKARI: "You go over your next move. I'll... take some time and think of mine."
    I think my heartrate is too high to concentrate on the board, but if she wants, I'll give it a try.
    Even after a minute of thinking over my position, I can still feel the adrenaline.
    What's she thinking about? Why am I so nervous?
    At least the game is a distraction. The trap isn't all that hard to spot. As long as I don't make the wrong choice, my king won't end up cornered. There's a clear way out.
    Is it the same for Hikari? Have I inadvertently threatened her?
    HIKARI: "Okay."
    TAKERU: "You're ready?"
    HIKARI: "Do you trust me?"
    TAKERU: "I'm not sure."
    I try for honesty.
    TAKERU: "Something is lying to me. Either it's you, Meiko and Natsumi, or else it's my brain lying to me."
    TAKERU: "I really want to trust you. I want to give it a shot."
    HIKARI: "Take my hand then."
    Same as last time she holds it out over the board. Horizontal, not like a handshake, palm up.
    This time though, she doesn't withdraw.
    I hold her hand.
    It's cold.
    Not cold like I've grabbed a handful of snow, but cool, like I've grabbed a handful of nothing.
    Then... I realize I have grabbed nothing. There is nothing between my fingers. Hikari's eyes are closed, her hand outstretched, but I cannot touch her and she is somewhere else entirely.
    She is not of this world.
    HIKARI: "You see how it is, isn't it?"
    TAKERU: "I-I don't understand."
    HIKARI: "You might've missed some details but you understood before you even came in."
    HIKARI: "It was me that died that day, most likely."
    HIKARI: "Don't ask why I'm still here."
    She chokes on air.
    She strikes me now as more distant, more alien than ever before.
    HIKARI: "Why don't you make your move?"
    TAKERU: "There. I'm moving the king this time. Done."
    HIKARI: "Hikari died from complications from a fire at Mirako's annual festival. And I'm Hikari, stuck here now."
    HIKARI: "Your friend Mana would call me a ghost, right?"
    HIKARI: "Bishop. B3."
    TAKERU: "Done."
    HIKARI: "I'm not sure how much anyone else can see me. All the other students remember who I was as a student, to some extent. They talk to me. They go through the motions."
    HIKARI: "Then the next day it's as if I never existed and I vanished almost a year ago."
    HIKARI: "Since you've come to Mirako, you've met what, how many people? Friendly people, right?"
    TAKERU: "That's right. And it's your move."
    HIKARI: "Building relationships with other people is what it means to be alive. I guess I really must be dead because I can't even do that. I have a day, even less, and then it's all reset to zero."
    TAKERU: "Then how are we talking now?"
    HIKARI: "One of life's mysteries I guess. Maybe you'll find the answer if you go walking around with robes and incense, but I don't think so."
    HIKARI: "You never knew me in life, and you said you had... some condition."
    TAKERU: "Schizophrenia."
    HIKARI: "That does make things complicated."
    She thinks for a moment. I'm about to reply when she gestures at the board for me to move a piece.
    HIKARI: "Do you believe me?"
    TAKERU: "I do."
    HIKARI: "You believe that I'm here, now, and you're talking to me, and not something you're imagining inside your head?"
    TAKERU: "I do."
    HIKARI: "I'm relieved. I really am. You can't imagine how much it means."
    Hikari stands up and stretches, beaming. I think it's the most expressive movement I've ever seen out of her.
    HIKARI: "Ever since you came back that second day I've been terrified you'd forget. You'd forget, or you'd never come back."
    HIKARI: "Now..."
    She sits back down and breathes in.
    HIKARI: "I don't want to impose on you. If that was overwhelming I'm sorry."
    TAKERU: "That's fine. I mean, I'm overwhelmed, but, you shouldn't be sorry."
    HIKARI: "No, I mean, for me, I've been stuck in a circle for year, and then... you, for you I'm one person, if you see."
    HIKARI: "Never mind. That doesn't matter now. What matters now is you know the truth."
    The strangest truth I've heard, but I've committed to believing it. There's no turning back.
    TAKERU: "Thanks for being honest with me. I'm still trying to piece some things together, but..."
    TAKERU: "At least I know I'm not going crazy."
    HIKARI: "We can only hope."
    HIKARI: "It's your move, by the way."
    I look down at the board.
    TAKERU: "Well... I don't have any moves left."
    HIKARI: "You..."
    TAKERU: "That should mean..."
    HIKARI: "It's a draw. Well done."
    While I can't come close to actually winning anything, at least I've managed to eke out something that's not a loss by hiding in a corner. It's the first time yet I haven't lost horribly to Hikari.
    TAKERU: "I guess it's a start."
    HIKARI: "Everything has to start somewhere, right? This is a good beginning. It's worth building on."
    HIKARI: "I can't force you to do anything, but, if you could keep visiting here, even only a bit..."
    TAKERU: "I'm pretty sure I'm down here daily anyway."
    HIKARI: "While you've seen it means a lot to me."
    TAKERU: "Do you ever leave the tearoom?"
    HIKARI: "You've seen me around. I go where I want, but it seems that I only ever want to be here. It's quiet. Nobody's ever here."
    HIKARI: "Maybe I'll make an effort."
    TAKERU: "An effort?"
    HIKARI: "Forget it, it's not important right now."
    HIKARI: "Don't you have class?"
    TAKERU: "Ah, dammit, almost forgot. I don't want to run, but..."
    HIKARI: "I'll see you later, I hope."
    TAKERU: "I'll be back. Have a little faith in me."
    She walks me to the door.
    I leave with almost as many questions as when I entered, but...
    Somehow things seem more orderly. Or have at least taken a step in that direction.
    
    As expected, I barely make to class on time. In fact, the only person later than me is Natsumi.
    While I feel like I could've spent another hour or two in the old wing, at least I don't have to suffer the embarassment of showing up after Natsumi again, (or deal with her smugness either).
    As classes start my focus isn't strong.
    My mind isn't knotted and disjointed like this morning, but it still seems like there's something more important than schoolwork right now.
    Plus I now have yet another tic setting me apart from my classmates. They've lost a classmate, and I've gained one. Does that give some responsibility to her?
    I can't imagine what it'd be to live a loop like that, where one day to the next, no one remembered and no one cared.
    Thinking back to that first day, no wonder she was so dismissive.
    NATSUMI: "Psst."
    TAKERU: "Oh what do you want?"
    NATSUMI: "Public service announcement. It's lunchtime. You can get up now."
    TAKERU: "What? Oh."
    She's not lying. Half the class is out the door, and the other half is Natsumi's crew. She crosses the room to join them.
    Time for lunch.
    At the doorway, I'm trying to decide to think if I should mention Hikari to Mana or Hagami when I hear a familiar voice. Two familiar voices, actually. Arguing?
    KENTA: "...so that's not how it's supposed to work. I'm perfectly willing to talk to her, but..."
    MEIKO: "What's her name?"
    KENTA: "How should I know?"
    MEIKO: "You have to work on this, Kenta. You were getting better last year, right?"
    KENTA: "Fine, fine. I still shouldn't have to remember her name to work with her though."
    MEIKO: "Oh, hey Takeru. Over here."
    Meiko waves me over to the corner of the hall, where Kenta stands with his arms crossed.
    KENTA: "Good afternoon, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Good afternoon, Kenta. Hey Meiko."
    TAKERU: "What's going on?"
    KENTA: "I have an uncooperative lab partner. Meiko used to help with these things last year, but..."
    MEIKO: "I'll see what I can do. Point her out sometime, okay?"
    KENTA: "Fine."
    MEIKO: "I'm sorry I can't do more but I've been a bit overwhelmed with festival work this year. It's really close."
    MEIKO: "Speaking of which... Have you made a start on contacting the people on those forms, Takeru?"
    TAKERU: "What? Er..."
    Honestly I'd forgotten they existed. And didn't I just get them yesterday?
    TAKERU: "No, I haven't. I'll get on that."
    TAKERU: "When should these be done?"
    MEIKO: "By the end of the week, we'll need everyone updated info. Let me know if you need help."
    TAKERU: "I don't think I can ask for help in the process of helping you out, can I?"
    KENTA: "Everyone goes to Meiko for help, so it's the usual."
    Meiko laughs without any sign of unease.
    Our group seems to have attracted someone else's attention as well.
    NATSUMI: "Well, hey everyone. How's it going, Kenta?"
    KENTA: "Good afternoon. Who are you?"
    NATSUMI: "I'm Natsumi, you dope. We're friends, remember?"
    KENTA: "No, not really."
    NATSUMI: "You always remember Meiko's name."
    Meiko maintains her smile while Natsumi pouts at her.
    KENTA: "I'll be late for lunch, so I'm going now. Bye."
    NATSUMI: "I didn't know you could be late to lunch like you could be late to class..."
    TAKERU: "For Kenta you could be late to anything."
    NATSUMI: "I like that guy."
    TAKERU: "Baffling."
    MEIKO: "Anyway, Takeru, if you don't know how to get in touch with someone listed there, come find me. Their class should be listed with their name so you'll know where to start."
    TAKERU: "Got it."
    I guess I didn't realize the job I'd signed up for involved hunting down random students. I'll recognize no one, no doubt.
    MEIKO: "I have a meeting to get to, so I'll leave you to enjoy your lunch. See you later."
    NATSUMI: "Seeya Meiko."
    Meiko waves as she turns and heads toward the front gates. Natsumi returns the gesture with a salute.
    NATSUMI: "That's Meiko for you. Always caught between helping people out and organizing a million things."
    There's no sarcasm to it. Somehow our school idol baseball captain looks up to her.
    NATSUMI: "She should be a CEO instead of lawyer. Too boring for her."
    TAKERU: "That's really her plan, is it?"
    NATSUMI: "Yep. If she survives the school festival, that is. Who knows how she wound up with all that responsibility."
    NATSUMI: "Good thing she's got you to back her up, right?"
    TAKERU: "I just do the grunt work."
    But by the way Natsumi's elbowing me and raising her eyebrows, that's probably not what she meant.
    TAKERU: "We've just known each other a while is all."
    NATSUMI: "Whatever. Actually..."
    I don't like that look.
    NATSUMI: "I've got an offer to make."
    TAKERU: "An offer? What?"
    NATSUMI: "I've got something to show you, so, come back in here."
    She points to the now empty classroom. I follow her in, but I'm regretting I didn't slip away while Meiko and Kenta still had me covered.
    TAKERU: "Is this going to take a while? I was sort of planning to meet some people for lunch."
    NATSUMI: "Oh, me too, don't worry. Let me just find this..."
    From her bag, she pulls out a spiralbound book with thick, glossy cover pages. It's a deep blue trimmed with gold, and front on the cover is a picture of...
    Tohoku High School.
    She rifles through the pages. Snapshots of baseball players flip past, some posing, some with groups. On the opposite page is a table filled with numbers and decimal points.
    It's a yearbook of sorts: the baseball yearbook, the only one that matters there. 
    Each player has a dedicated page with their yearly averages, record, and any other relevant stats, almost as detailed as the majors.
    She stops about halfway through. It's the pitching pages. This particular pitcher only posted two losses the entire season. A fastball speed that reaches the high 70s. His ERA is listed. Best in the school.
    And only a freshman, too. He'll be unstoppable as a senior.
    The young man in the portrait is grinning. He's confident. His hat is pulled low over his face as he gives a thumbs up to the camera.
    Natsumi takes her index finger at jams the name at the top of the profile a few times and says it aloud, as if I had any trouble reading.
    NATSUMI: "Ichiro. Takeru."
    TAKERU: "W-Where did you get this?"
    NATSUMI: "I want this guy on my baseball team."
    TAKERU: "That's not me."
    NATSUMI: "You're not this goofy guy in the picture? Is he your twin or something? A clone?"
    TAKERU: "He's not me any more."
    Natsumi waves her hand to clear away confusion.
    NATSUMI: "Okay, okay. You probably don't want to play for some backwater team like Mirako's, but there's a tournament coming up. Baseball's the only sport we're competitive in. It means something around here to us, anyway."
    TAKERU: "It's not that... I don't think I'm better than you all, I - "
    NATSUMI: "Hiyama was our ace in the hole. It's a five game series and I had him up for games one and five, but he broke two fingers yesterday and there's no way he's going to be ready to go in time."
    NATSUMI: "You just need to pitch those two games. Then you're done. You can play with us or no, I just need one more guy to wrap up this season."
    TAKERU: "You don't want me on your team. Trust me you don't want me pitching. I haven't touched a baseball in months and I'm worried - "
    TAKERU: "I don't think I have to explain this to you. See you later, Natsumi."
    NATSUMI: "Takeru, wait up!"
    But as I leave the room and brush through the crowd in the hall, she stops following at the doorway.
    Her mouth is scrunched up and she's clutching that terrible Tohoku yearbook to her chest.
    How long has she had that?
    I have no idea where she got the thing, but I'd be happier if all copies were burned. It wasn't a lie when I said that kid in the picture wasn't me any more.
    
    I wind up at the old library, but I hesitate outside the door.
    Mana and Hagami will calm me down after Natsumi's bizarre offer, I'm sure, but I don't want to talk about Hikari to them at this point. I still haven't decided how to broach that particular subject.
    Plus the door is closed today. Odd.
    I open it and enter to a familiar scene, but just missing a detail.
    TAKERU: "Hi Hagami. Where's Mana?"
    She shrugs and returns to her book.
    TAKERU: "Looks like it's just me and you today."
    HAGAMI: "Oh well."
    TAKERU: "Please, I'm not that terrible."
    Hagami laughs. I'm a bit relieved that was a joke.
    I start unpacking my lunch, and Hagami clears away some books for me to set my things down.
    The radio's up louder than usual. Whatever's playing is currently between orchestral pieces and someone's providing commentary in German. I still don't think I understand Hagami.
    Thinking back, we haven't really eaten together without Mana since that very first day, where Hagami practically fled the room.
    At least now it looks like I've been downgraded from a threat to a minor friendly presence. Like, maybe a housecat or something.
    I start eating, but even so, I feel uneasy.
    It's probably normal for Hagami, but even a few minutes of silence alone with somebody feels uncomfortable.
    TAKERU: "Read anything interesting lately?"
    Even asking seems stupid.
    HAGAMI: "Not really."
    She flips up her book to show me the title. It's new from her usual genre. It appears to be some kind of medical manual.
    TAKERU: "'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems?'"
    TAKERU: "That seems a little morbid. What're you - "
    I glance at the header at the top of the current page. Psychiatry. Then... Schizophrenia?
    TAKERU: "What're you up to, anyway?"
    She must've caught my glance because she flips half the manual forward and arrives at the section on corneal ulcers.
    HAGAMI: "Just the usual."
    But she blushes, then adjusts a knob on the radio.
    After a few moments, she seems to have a change of heart and dials it down again. The German narrator fades to a whisper.
    HAGAMI: "Thanks for going on the field expedition with Mana."
    TAKERU: "If I remember, a certain someone set me up for that."
    But she doesn't appear to be joking around. She continues in a monotone.
    HAGAMI: "We used to both go. Once this year Just... something we could both relate to."
    HAGAMI: "She..."
    HAGAMI: "I don't what she believes or not, but last year... Some unhappy things happened at Mirako."
    HAGAMI: "It's best to be respectful."
    TAKERU: "I think I understand. She's a freshman, so she wouldn't know anything about the fire last year."
    HAGAMI: "Hm."
    Hagami nods. She seems a bit surprised I was aware, but otherwise it doesn't look like she feels too strongly about it one way or the other.
    I wonder what last year would've been like for Hagami, without Mana around constantly. It doesn't seem like something I should talk about.
    TAKERU: "When did you meet Mana? It seems crazy it was less than a year ago."
    HAGAMI: "It wasn't."
    TAKERU: "What?"
    HAGAMI: "Middle school."
    TAKERU: "Oh. Right. I'm sure she was even more off the walls then."
    HAGAMI: "Not really. She was quieter."
    Hagami looks up from the pages of her disease book and glances at the stack of paperbacks next to me. They're all titled some number variant of "Sayaka's Rose-colored Days at Phantom High."
    HAGAMI: "And I was the one reading those."
    HAGAMI: "I've moved on more important knowledge."
    ...and she raises her own book. I can't tell if she's joking.
    TAKERU: "I think I'd rather hit myself in the head with that thing than read it."

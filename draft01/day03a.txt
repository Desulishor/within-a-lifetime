label day03a:

    Morning in our room is a nightmare.
    For once I was allowed to sleep in, but as soon as I wake up I realize at what cost.
    TAKERU: "Kenta."
    KENTA: "Good morning Takeru."
    TAKERU: "What is this?"
    KENTA: "What is what? And you're supposed to say 'good morning.'"
    TAKERU: "Good morning Kenta."
    KENTA: "Good morning Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Now what is... this?"
    I gesture at the carnage at the foot of my bed.
    TAKERU: "Why are there coins all over the floor? Why are there clothes all over the dressers? Where are the dresser drawers?"
    KENTA: "I'm categorizing the coins for storage. They're kind of taking up a lot of space."
    TAKERU: "Well I'm glad you've wised up about that one. Does this mean I get my dresser back?"
    KENTA: "Your dresser? I thought we shared a dresser."
    TAKERU: "Er, yeah, but I didn't exactly... Let me just get my clothes."
    No sooner do I step out of bed then Kenta leaps up in terror.
    KENTA: "Hey! Watch out!"
    TAKERU: "What?"
    KENTA: "Your foot! You're standing in the Americas collection. That's sorted by date you know."
    I look down. It's all coins to me.
    Actually, I'm pretty much trapped by coins. Surrounded. 
    KENTA: "If you need to get up, we can move some of the collections."
    TAKERU: "I'm sorry Kenta, I need to get up to Mirako for lunch. Can you just throw me my clothes or something?"
    KENTA: "Are you looking for a patterned shirt today or color? The socks are coded by their matches as well, one per shirt. You'll find I have a good eye for men's fashion as well."
    TAKERU: "Can you even say that with a straight face? Your shirt's on backwards again."
    KENTA: "Oh. So it is."
    TAKERU: "Just tell me where I can find some pants."
    Kenta points at the top of what should by all rights be my dresser. A stack of tightly folded clothes lie on top, but the dresser itself is surrounded by a minefield of coins.
    KENTA: "Semi-formal and formal are over there. Casual clothes I've temporarily relocated to the bathroom."
    TAKERU: "You know what, I'm just going back to bed."
    Just as I was starting to think I could find some sense of normalcy here. Oh well.
    It takes me twice as long as it should to traverse the dorm via a tiptoe and jumps, and not without a few nervous admonishments from Kenta.
    
    By the time I find myself outside it's already noon. My only consolation is that when I return, I might actually have some private space in my own room.
    Well, or I could have a dresser full of trifolded socks, but I need to think positive ahead of my meeting with Meiko.
    Meeting sounds too formal. It certainly isn't a date. I don't know how she so nonchalantly managed to ask me to catch up over coffee.
    She doesn't feel awkward about our parting at all? Even so, it's just the way things go that opposite sex friendships fall apart towards middle school.
    For her to be so self-assured seems like she's got everything figured out already.
    And it's also not what I would've expected of her.
    While I'm not feeling nervous, I'm more... incredulous? Or ashamed I can't greet my friend with a clean conscience? Again, there's no good word for it. 
    ...
    It's no use worrying now. I need to pick up my pace if I want to get up this hill at a reasonable hour.
    
    I arrive at the gate sweating a bit from extertion. Mirako still seems so hot this late in the summer.
    Where was I supposed to meet Meiko again? She said she had business with the student council or something?
    In the distance I here a dull clang.
    An aluminum bat meeting a ball.
    What should be nostalgic instead sets me on edge. I'll wait inside.
    MEIKO: "Takeru! You made it."
    TAKERU: "Ah! Hi. I didn't see you, sorry."
    It's like she was lying in ambush at the school doors.
    MEIKO: "I was waiting outside but the sun started to get to me."
    TAKERU: "Sorry for keeping you, I ran into some... issues at my dorm."
    MEIKO: "Haha, you'll have to tell me about. You room with Kenta, right?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah."
    MEIKO: "Well first why don't we figure out where we're going?"
    TAKERU: "I'm sorry if I'm not much help deciding."
    MEIKO: "Don't worry about that. There's a good cafe in town I know. Let's start walking now though, it'd be a shame to get there and it turns out they've stopped serving lunch.
    We head back the way I came.
    The conversation isn't as bad as I'd expect. Meiko seems to know all about the acquaintances I left behind at the old middle school we used to attend together. She remembers a lot more of them than I do.
    But I notice she confines herself to those short years between when I left and when she must've come to Mirako.
    I wonder...
    We both grew up a long ways from here. What prompted her move.
    I do my best to ask about those half-friends I haven't thought of in years, but I'm still uneasy. Meiko's laugh seems so natural.
    Finally we reach the base of the hill and the town of Mirako proper.
    TAKERU: "This is the second time walking that road this morning... Why'd they go and build a school on top of a hill?"
    MEIKO: "You have to admit it's quite the view, though."
    TAKERU: "True."
    To tell the truth I've more been concentrating on avoiding any bombshells in the conversation than on admiring the scenery.
    TAKERU: "Where's this coffee shop?"
    MEIKO: "Just down the main road a ways."
    MEIKO: "Mirako's a great town. You can find whatever you need if you know where to looks. Bookstores, fast food, a movie theater, good restaurants... not that I can really afford the restaurants, haha."
    MEIKO: "It's just all a little more spread out than a big city. Do you have a bike?"
    TAKERU: "No. I think I'd die on that road up to school."
    She laughs again.
    MEIKO: "Maybe, maybe. I haven't invested in one myself. Again, a little short on funds..."
    MEIKO: "I honestly don't come into town too often. There's always so much work to do at school."
    TAKERU: "You seem to have your fingers in a lot of pots."
    MEIKO: "Hmm, it does look that way, doesn't it?"
    MEIKO: "But I guess it's nice to be appreciate as a class rep, and for what I get done with the council and the other boards... You can't let anyone down."
    She looks away. At first I wonder if she's trying to hide her expression, but instead she points out a building on the corner.
    MEIKO: "That's the place."
    
    It's called the "Cat's Corner Cafe." The interior is small.
    I almost expected Meiko's favorite place to be little more upscale, but I guess that'd be difficult to afford on a student's budget.
    Business seems slow, too. A few old men reading newspapers, a young man with a laptop, a middle-aged couple grabbing a late lunch...
    It still doesn't feel at all like a place that'd be frequented by high school students.
    TAKERU: "I have no idea what to order at a place like this."
    MEIKO: "The sandwiches are pretty good. A turkey melt maybe?"
    TAKERU: "What are you getting."
    MEIKO: "Just a small coffee. I actually brought lunch and ate with the student council members up at Mirako..."
    TAKERU: "Huh."
    She blushes.
    MEIKO: "Sorry, it'd be rude to not eat with them and I didn't want to head out early. I should've had half a meal here and half there I guess. Sorry Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Don't worry about it. Showing me around Mirako is well, more than I deserve already."
    Meiko mostly talks about the town while I eat.

    Mirako is all but deserted at this hour. Passing through the gym, I only see two or three students, all heading the opposite direction. The fireworks will be starting soon, so no doubt they don't want to miss it.
    Once I enter the old wing, the school is truly empty. Every other light is dark, and by now there's no trace of the sun through the windows. The bustle of the field seems so far removed now.
    I pass the tea room on the right, then come to the piano room on the left. The hallway is dark, but light shines underneath the door.
    Of course Hagami is here. I knew she had to be. The only question now is... what do I do? Just the same as this morning, I'm struck by a sensation that I shouldn't be here. If Hagami wants to be alone, then that's her right. Do I...?
    TAKERU: "Come on..."
    Hikari told me to go for it. I'll trust her. My heart steadily rises in my chest, but I slide open the door. I know I'll find her, and I know I don't have a plan, but I have to do it.
    TAKERU: "Hagami?"
    HAGAMI: "...?"
    She's sitting on the piano stool. When I enter, she turns to face me, her face blank. In the time I've known her, I've gotten better at reading her, but... I'm at a loss.
    It's hard to seperate what I'm feeling from what she must be thinking. That falling, sinking feeling that something's gone irrevocably wrong... Is that my own emotion, or something I see in her? I can't tell, and it forces me into a stupid joke.
    TAKERU: "Hey."
    HAGAMI: "Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Did you really have to set those fake bids up in my name? Natsumi wouldn't let me live it down. Plus, she won all the furniture anyway, so it looks like I'll be busy tonight."
    TAKERU: "Er, I mean, I agreed to help her move anything she won, but then she won pretty much everything, and she bribed Kenta with a cabinet, but I'll have to move that anyways, and, er..."
    Hagami raises an eyebrow as I ramble. I hate to embarass myself, but, relieve that she hasn't kicked me out already, I collapse onto a dusty chair opposite some shelves.
    HAGAMI: "Sorry."
    HAGAMI: "I wish I could've been there. To see it."
    TAKERU: "To see the expressions on Meiko and Mana when they thought I'd bid six figures on Kenta's lousy flatpack furniture? You're crueler than I thought."
    HAGAMI: "Maybe."
    She breaks eye contact and faces the piano again. There's another several second gap where my guts bounce around inside my ribcage. I'm grateful when she breaks the silence.
    HAGAMI: "Mana must..."
    HAGAMI: "Is she alright?"
    TAKERU: "She's kind of upset. She thinks she let you down."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Hagami, I'm sorry, I didn't..."
    TAKERU: "I think it's me that let you down."
    TAKERU: "I pushed you to sign up for all this when you stopped with the paperwork, and I forced things through with Meiko, and even when you told me you weren't comfortable with performing, I - "
    HAGAMI: "No."
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    HAGAMI: "I owe you for that."
    TAKERU: "I don't get it. I think I've screwed it all up. I didn't listen when you were trying to back out of all of this, and I let slip to Mana you were going to perform, and..."
    TAKERU: "I guess I came down here to apologize. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have had to be up there, and we'd be sitting with Mana and Meiko and everyone right now watching the fireworks."
    HAGAMI: "I'm glad I'm not."
    TAKERU: "You're... what?"
    HAGAMI: "I'm sick of it."
    HAGAMI: "Waiting, hiding, wishing I could be someone else."
    HAGAMI: "I... I don't want to be some mute all my life. A shadow hanging around the library."
    HAGAMI: "Takeru... What exactly do you think of me?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    TAKERU: "I guess, you're smart, you're obviously talented, and then, you've got your hangups, just like everyone else at Mirako, but..."
    HAGAMI: "I hate that."
    HAGAMI: "Pity. I don't want that. It's disgusting, and every minute I spend down here, hiding, I hate myself. Mana always cared about me even if I was useless, spending all my time running away from people instead of..."
    HAGAMI: "I don't want to be a shutin, Takeru. I want to be a world-class musician."
    TAKERU: "Er... Sorry. I'm sure you are, it's just..."
    HAGAMI: "You've never even heard me play."
    TAKERU: "No."
    HAGAMI: "That's why I hate. I absolutely hate it! If I can't even stand up there in front of you all and play, it doesn't matter. It's useless."
    TAKERU: "I don't think you're useless."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Er... I thought it was brave. I'm sorry, I haven't really thought this out, but even when you said you weren't feeling it, and you knew you'd probably not be able to do it, you got out there, so..."
    HAGAMI: "If I don't get the results, it doesn't matter."
    TAKERU: "I don't - "
    HAGAMI: "One second."
    She silences me and faces the piano.
    Her fingers are suspended over the keys. I'm reminded of her up on the stage, motionless for minutes, poised to begin playing, but this time, there's only a second to wait.
    Hagami lowers her fingers, melds them into the keys, the most natural motion in the world. My ear for music is terrible, but even I can appreciate what I hear. The music is soft but deliberate, slow and shining, worthy of the title "moonlight."

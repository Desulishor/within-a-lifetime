label day10:

    I'm up almost before the sun.
    Last night I set the alarm for almost an hour earlier than normal, but I'm awake even before that. Guess a little paranoia never hurt.
    In that aftermath of yesterday's disaster there are a few things I want to get done this morning.
    That box with all my Tohoku memorabilia is still out in the open. I'm tempted to burn it or else dig a hole and bury it out back, but I settle for wrapping the whole thing in duct take and shoving it back in the cabinet. Lighting it on fire would probably wake Kenta up.
    It can't be healthy wondering what's inside those letters from Meiko. I can imagine. I'm pretty sure I did imagine yesterday.
    But isn't this running away? Would finally reading them get me to stop worrying about them for once? No. No of course not. That's what the duct tape's for.
    With that taken care of, I'm almost ready to go, when, of course, Kenta stumbles out of bed, punctuating his speech with yawns.
    KENTA: "Good... Good morning, Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Yeah, good morning. I was about to leave a note, but I'm headed to Mirako. See you."
    KENTA: "You... what? Did you take your - "
    TAKERU: "It's been less than a day. Do you really think I'm going to forget that easily?"
    KENTA: "No, but, well, you did have a long phone call with that doctor yesterday, so, maybe something had changed."
    TAKERU: "Same old stuff. They want me to go in to the clinic for a few days for observation, but, I think I'm doing alright here. I just can't forget again."
    To be honest though, I'm playing it down. Dr. Meadow wanted me back for a "few weeks" and the call was only that long because the last thing I want to do is have to start back at Mirako all over again. Instead, I'll fix this myself.
    Which is why I need to leave early.
    TAKERU: "See you later then, Kenta."
    KENTA: "Have... Have a good morning."
    
    It's cooler than I'd like on the road up to Mirako. Cool enough where I should probably invest in a coat, because I'm pretty sure I just sealed my only overcoat (maroon with the Tohoku seal) into a cardboard box.
    When I get to the Mirako gate, I miss a step and almost fall over.
    I regain my balance and hesitate, looking up at Mirako's glass windows shimmering in the rising sun.
    Idiotic. Why am I hesitating now? I worked out a plan last night, I knew how to fix this, and now I'm stuck before I even set a foot in the doors.
    Dr. Meadow's recommendation was that I stay in my room today, then come in for observation tomorrow, and we'd reconsider Mirako next semester because somewhere someone had underestimated the extent of my illness.
    Remembering the circumstances of my first admission, I really don't see how any could've "underestimated" it. This was nowhere near as bad as that first time and I'll be damned if I just run away from all of it again.
    I took my pills today, so things should be fine. Just start walking again, get through that gate, get through that door, and go find -
    HIKARI: "Takeru. A little early isn't it?"
    ...Hikari.
    TAKERU: "H-hello Hikari. You're..."
    HIKARI: "You didn't expect to see me?"
    TAKERU: "No, not really. I was just going to find you. I thought you'd be, well..."
    HIKARI: "In an abandoned tea room somewhere, sulking?"
    TAKERU: "Basically."
    I'll leave out that I had no idea if she'd be pleased to see me or not. Yesterday... Maybe it was just me, but when she appeared in class she was nothing but pure malice.
    The Hikari next to me doesn't seem concerned about that. She seems more concerned about me.
    HIKARI: "I've been trying to push things. I never really knew what I could, or what I couldn't do. There never seemed to be a point to wandering around, so I stuck to where I was comfortable."
    HIKARI: "Do you always come before classes and just stand here?"
    TAKERU: "...No."
    HIKARI: "Then why - "
    TAKERU: "Yesterday was a bit interesting. Alright, it was a disaster, so I'm trying to..."
    HIKARI: "Waiting here doesn't exactly solve anything does it? Let's get some tea. I'm interested to hear about it."
    TAKERU: "Thanks. Okay, you're right."
    I follow her down the pathway and into Mirako proper.
    With nobody in the halls, we head for the old wing.
    TAKERU: "This sounds like a stupid question, and it's been bothering me, but..."
    HIKARI: "If it's bothering you, it's by definition important."
    TAKERU: "Did we talk at all yesterday?"
    HIKARI: "No."
    TAKERU: "Really?"
    HIKARI: "I went to your class in the afternoon to try and find you, but no luck."
    TAKERU: "You're telling the truth?"
    HIKARI: "The truth as I know it. Memory can be a funny thing."
    TAKERU: "..."
    We arrive at the tea room. I don't bother trying to figure out the implications of what Hikari's trying to say, and instead just concentrate on making tea.
    HIKARI: "Why don't you try explaining exactly what happened?"
    TAKERU: "I lost it. Remember I said I felt like some edges didn't quite match up? Like people forgetting who you were, saying they'd never met you."
    HIKARI: "...I remember."
    TAKERU: "It was sort of like that, but everywhere. I forgot to take my pills, and then..."
    TAKERU: "Do you know shizophrenia?"
    HIKARI: "In an abstract way. The details..."
    TAKERU: "Well, somewhere, what I saw happening stopped being at all related to what was actually happening."
    TAKERU: "I... saw you in class. And at lunch."
    HIKARI: "I was never there. My own memory's been losing its... Well, that's not the relevant. No, I definitely wasn't there."
    TAKERU: "...And probably I didn't see you at lunch, either."
    HIKARI: "No."
    TAKERU: "..."
    HIKARI: "You're seeing me know, if that's what you're wondering. I'm really here. You didn't just invent me out of nothing."
    TAKERU: "Right. Okay. There's a ton happening, but here's a place to start."
    TAKERU: "I told you about Meiko? How I let her down?"
    HIKARI: "I heard the basics."
    TAKERU: "I was totally wrong about her.
    Hikari has both hands out over her cup of tea. I wonder if that actually warms her up? Nevertheless, she's hanging on every word, so I might as well take this opportunity to put everything together.
    TAKERU: "She never really forgave me."
    HIKARI: "...What?"
    TAKERU: "She said... it was an act, mostly. She just wanted to prove she didn't need me, so she was acting all gracious and composed. I think she still hates me."
    TAKERU: "Guess she just wanted to show she could shrug people off as easily as I could back then."
    HIKARI: "I don't believe it."
    TAKERU: "That's what she - "
    But Hikari doesn't seem to be in disbelief, just upset.
    HIKARI: "Not Meiko. No."
    TAKERU: "You know her? Or... knew her, I guess?"
    HIKARI: "Yes, but... I haven't seen in her in almost a year now. I think you're wrong about her, but, it's not important. Keep going."
    TAKERU: "I hadn't talked to Meiko since she came out with that, and then..."
    TAKERU: "It must not have actually happened, but I heard her... It wasn't an accusation, but, more..."
    TAKERU: "More terrible. It couldn't have been real. I don't know where that voice came from. She told me I'm a coward because I keep running away from remotely unpleasant without worrying about what it'll do to other people."
    TAKERU: "Whether it was her or not, it was pretty spot on."
    HIKARI: "Not really."
    HIKARI: "You're here, talking to me, a person who probably couldn't be called a person any more, even after you found that out. You're still at Mirako, even after what sounds like a nightmare yesterday."
    TAKERU: "I up and left Meiko once. No idea how I'm supposed to talk to her now... And after things went wrong at Tohoku I escaped out to Mirako."
    TAKERU: "And I don't even know why I why I'm here talking to you. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I hurt anyone. If that happened again I'd probably prove Meiko right and go back to the clinic."
    TAKERU: "I don't want that happening again. Ever."
    HIKARI: "Takeru..."
    HIKARI: "You never did tell me what happened at Tohoku."
    TAKERU: "It's..."
    In a moment I'll probably be lying to her, so I try to avoid looking her in the eye.
    HIKARI: "I know you're hiding it. Or at least avoiding it. I think... if you brought everything in the open, it might help."
    TAKERU: "It's not a very pleasant story. And I end up looking worse than dirt."
    HIKARI: "I don't judge. You can trust me."
    I remember that hand she held out, the hand I tried to grasp but couldn't. She trusted me then, that I wouldn't run away screaming.
    Right. I'll try it, Hikari.
    TAKERU: "I think it wasn't even a month into my second season, er, second year at Tohoku High. I hadn't been feeling great for a while but I put it down to nerves. I never really got nervous before, but..."
    TAKERU: "I was supposed to be the top of the rotation pitcher for one of the top national teams. So when little details didn't add up, or I heard the wrong person say something, or it turned out nobody said it... I thought it was just stress or something."
    Hikari nods. I figure she can relate.
    TAKERU: "The team captain, Yoshida, was probably the only guy with a bigger profile than me, but that's mostly because he was mean as hell. We let him get away with pushing us around because, well, we won games, and he usually saved the worst of it for the other team."
    TAKERU: "It must've been Sunday practice, but I was pitching to him. We had an argument, and er, the specifics aren't important I guess..."
    HIKARI: "I don't mind."
    TAKERU: "No, really, they aren't. I don't even remember. From what I saw, he called time. Walked out of the batter's box. Then he sort of... called for the ball? For me throw it to him?"
    TAKERU: "I'm told that didn't happen."
    Hikari still has her attention focused on the cup of tea. When I don't continue, she looks up, but doesn't interrupt.
    TAKERU: "I hit him with a fastball in the jaw, broke it in two places."
    TAKERU: "I don't know what happened to him after that. I doubt he ever came back that season."
    TAKERU: "Everyone was livid, they thought I'd just hit him because of some dumb argument. They all thought I was just lying. So they dragged a sports psychologist in, then the real psychologist, then a psychiatrist, then a psychologist again..."
    TAKERU: "So now I'm here at Mirako. And I never want to touch a baseball again, let alone get into this weird... state. People just wind up hurt and I don't even recognize it."
    HIKARI: "Physically, or...?"
    TAKERU: "No one's giving me a driver's license or issuing permits to operate heavy machinery to an idiot like me, so at this point I'm less worried about physically injuring anyone..."
    TAKERU: "But Meiko proved her point. I don't need help from a mental illness to injure people."
    HIKARI: "Thanks for explaining."
    TAKERU: "Thank you for listening to my stupid story where I break my captain's jaw and then shoot my career in the foot before it ever begins. You can feel free to leave now."
    HIKARI: "At least appreciate it when I'm trying to be sincere. I'm not going anywhere. You understand you're my only real link to Mirako now, right? Stories like that are all I've got."
    TAKERU: "...I guess. It's a lousy story."
    HIKARI: "It's the human condition. All stories are lousy."
    TAKERU: "I don't need to hear anything from you about the 'human condition.'"
    HIKARI: "Very funny."
    TAKERU: "Look, I get this is just a spectator sport for you but I'm trying to figure out what exactly I screwed up yesterday and how to fix it."
    HIKARI: "Then, to start..."
    HIKARI: "I think you're wrong about Meiko."
    TAKERU: "How? About what?"
    Hikari closes her eyes for a few moments.
    HIKARI: "She's not a malicious person. She could never carry a grudge for years and then... She can't hold it against you now, no way. She's more fiery than she looks on the surface, but..."
    TAKERU: "None of that happened with Meiko yesterday, right, but on Sunday she was pretty clear."
    HIKARI: "Then she's..."
    HIKARI: "I didn't want Meiko to have changed. Maybe what happened last year cut deeper than I thought."
    Hikari looks like she's concentrating, but she doesn't speak. Finally she lets out a forlorn sigh.
    TAKERU: "You really did know her, didn't you?"
    HIKARI: "...Don't classes start soon?"
    TAKERU: "Er, right, I almost lost track of time. Thanks for hearing me out and not up and leaving on me."
    ...and don't think I didn't notice that change of subject.
    HIKARI: "I hope you can work things out, Takeru. I don't think it's all as bad as you think it is."
    HIKARI: "Look out for Meiko if you can."
    TAKERU: "It's a bit late, but I'll do my best."
    Hikari stands in the doorway of the tearoom as I leave.
    She watches after me, but doesn't return my goodbye. There's that same look of frustration on her face.
    Yoshida's injury and my humiliating departure from Tohoku aren't exactly things I like to dwell on, but looks like something equally painful came up for her.
    I wish I could take the time to figure it out, but I have my own agenda to get through today. I head for homeroom.

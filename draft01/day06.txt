label day06:

    My instinct when I wake up is to curl into my ball and cover my forehead.
    But... apparently even though I was out so late last night, I haven't overslept. There's no Kenta poised to pounce on me from above.
    ...then why does it feel like something is looming over me?
    I open my eyes to a blurry vision of the dorm at morning. I only truly feel safe when I hear soft breathing from Kenta on the other side of the room. Snoring. Still asleep.
    I can't seem to focus right.
    Was last night really that big a deal that I'm still spinning this morning?
    As I predicted, it was a disaster, and the only thing I really have to show for this whole ghost hunt business is going to be an awkward conversation with Hikari.
    Well, I guess it's not like I ever believed in ghosts anyway, so what did I expect really?
    KENTA: "...snuagh..."
    TAKERU: "He must really be out of it..."
    What time is it anyway?
    I try opening my eyes but they're already open. I can't see the alarm clock on my dresser through the blurriness. And why does everything have a green tinge to it? And what stinks?
    That incense must've really done a number on me...
    Then my focus changes.
    There is something standing over me.
    Two eyes.
    Translucent turquoise skin covering its blobby body.
    TAKERU: "G-g-g-ghost!"
    TAKERU: "G-ghost... frog."
    TAKERU: "That's an honest to god pickled frog."
    KENTA: "Takeru! You can stop screaming. I'm glad you're up early but it's a little early to give me a wakeup call."
    KENTA: "And what's with the yelling? I wasn' that deep asleep, was - ?"
    TAKERU: "Kenta!"
    KENTA: "I said I'm awake."
    TAKERU: "There is a frog on my dresser. There is a jar of weird liquid in it on my dresser, and in that jar there is a frog. Why is there a frog on my dresser? Kenta, what on earth - "
    KENTA: "Good morning Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, why on earth did you - "
    KENTA: "Good morning Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Good morning, Kenta. Now can you just explain this..."
    I gesture around the room.
    It's actually worse than I thought. There are a few jars arranged in a grid in the middle of the floor, and that white bucket is also taking up real estate on my dresser next to that terrible terrible frog.
    It's still looking at me.
    TAKERU: "Why did you pickle a frog and stand it over me, Kenta?"
    KENTA: "The proper term is embalming. It's a preserved frog. I wouldn't pickle it unless I wanted to eat it, and - "
    TAKERU: "Alright, sorry. What's with the preserved frog?"
    KENTA: "I'm branching out. Turns out insects themselves aren't very interesting, but preserving them is. What do you think of my first attempt on something larger? A little amateurish, maybe, but with practice..."
    TAKERU: "Great."
    KENTA: "I'm glad you're interested in my hobbies. It's so much easier to have someone who understands you."
    Next to my alarm clock, wallet, and ID, that coin Kenta gave me catches my attention.
    TAKERU: "I'm really not sure I understand."
    KENTA: "I can fill you in on the details this afternoon, if you like. For now we'd probably better start getting ready for school."
    TAKERU: "Probably."
    I sigh and look away from the coin. In a parallel world, I slept an extra thirty minutes and took my clothes out of that dresser currently occupied by dead insects and amphibians.
    KENTA: "What were you shouting about ghosts for?"
    TAKERU: "You must've misheard."
    KENTA: "If you say."
    TAKERU: "One of these days we're going into town and buying you a cabinet or a trophy case, or..."
    TAKERU: "Just... Something. I swear."
    KENTA: "That's a good thought. If I do end up using the rest of that methyl alcohol on snakes, I'll be out of display space soon."
    TAKERU: "I more meant so you could get the bugs out of the dresser, but..."
    TAKERU: "Just get ready to go."
    
    The air is completely still in the morning as we walk up the hill road.
    It passes mostly in silence. Even the rumbling of cars from the town below seems muffled.
    This same path seems almost familiar now, although I probably haven't been at Mirako a month.
    At this rate maybe I'll even get used to my roommate.
    KENTA: "Where were you last night, anyway?"
    TAKERU: "I wasn't vandalizing anything, don't worry."
    KENTA: "And my gloves?"
    TAKERU: "They're back in the right drawers."
    KENTA: "You can be a very considerate person when you want to be."
    TAKERU: "Thanks?"
    KENTA: "You weren't at Mirako, were you?"
    TAKERU: "Well... Maybe."
    I think I'll avoid bringing up ghost hunting, partially because all I did last night was make myself look stupid, and partially because I'm worried Kenta will pick up an occult hobby to go with his collections of dead things.
    I really need to get Mana's stories out of my mind. She probably doesn't even believe Mirako's haunted. 
    And it's hard to tell what Hagami's thinking about, but I wonder if she even cares about the supernatural, with those philosophy books of hers.
    It's pretty embarassing if even if the supernatural club members aren't believers.
    The only strange stuff I've seen at Mirako haven't really been supernatural at all. There was that weird episode on this very road with Meiko, and maybe...
    No one ever seems willing to acknowledge they know Hikari's name.
    TAKERU: "Kenta..."
    KENTA: "Takeru."
    TAKERU: "You haven't heard any rumors about the old half of Mirako being haunted or anything, right?"
    KENTA: "Haunting isn't a real thing, Takeru. I didn't know you were that silly."
    I don't know if I've ever valued Kenta's straightforwardness as much as now.
    TAKERU: "Thanks."
    TAKERU: "Alright... There's no, like, taboo at Mirako is there?"
    KENTA: "Taboo?"
    TAKERU: "Blackballing people. Or..."
    TAKERU: "There's nothing like a silent treatment? Like if somebody blows a save in the title game, everyone pretends they don't exist for a week?"
    KENTA: "That sounds bizarre. Why would you just stop talking to someone?"
    TAKERU: "I don't know. I've just felt a little shaken up these past couple days. People not remembering things the way I did."
    KENTA: "I thought there was medication for that."
    TAKERU: "Wait."
    Kenta swivels his head around as I stop dead.
    TAKERU: "My meds! Sorry, you can just go on without me."
    I take off back down the road.
    Idiot, idiot, idiot.
    It's been three months since I started taking the antipsychotics and but I've been pretty good about it. Until today I've taken them first thing every morning, every day.
    Right?
    ...
    Can't be. I'd notice if I missed a day.
    Right?
    KENTA: "Slow down, would you? I don't want to show up to school all sweaty."
    TAKERU: "You didn't have to come back with me you know."
    He trails behind as we walk back into the dorm.
    TAKERU: "Let me just catch my breath and grab my meds, it shouldn't take long. You could've still made it on time."
    KENTA: "Showing up at Mirako without you is just as much out of the routine as showing up late."
    TAKERU: "There. Sorry for the wait."
    Still almost panting, I check my watch.
    TAKERU: "There's still some time. Shouldn't have to run."
    If it weren't for that floating frog waking me up, we would be late for sure.
    Then again, if it wasn't for the commotion that horrible thing caused, I wouldn't have screwed up my pills in the first place.
    KENTA: "This is why it's important to stick to plans. My morning schedule has a spot for medicine. It rotates every seven days, synchronized to which dresser drawer has clothes for that day, which also..."
    TAKERU: "You take pills now?"
    KENTA: "Just anti-anxiety."
    TAKERU: "Huh. You're about the last person I'd expect to be anxious."
    He shrugs.
    KENTA: "A few years ago if you had made be late I'd be a lot angrier with you."
    KENTA: "Mirako is a great place."
    TAKERU: "..."
    TAKERU: "I never really explained why I came here, did I? Came to Mirako, I mean."
    KENTA: "No, I don't think so."
    I can't remember him ever asking, for sure.
    Is that his form of respect? Incuriosity?
    KENTA: "If it was something you needed to share you would've shared it. It's important to share things that are important to you."
    TAKERU: "Right, just like you can't help sharing the bugs and the frogs and the clothing sorting system."
    KENTA: "You're welcome."
    TAKERU: "...Thanks Kenta."
    KENTA: "We're here."
    
    I show up to class barely on time. No sign of the homeroom teacher but Meiko has started in on her daily state of the class address.
    I'm haven't stopped panting by the time I reach my seat.
    NATSUMI: "How's the morning jog treating you?"
    TAKERU: "I don't need to hear it from you."
    NATSUMI: "A sorry day when even I beat you in. What held you up?"
    TAKERU: "Oh, nothing. Just got a late start."
    NATSUMI: "Well don't be late after class today."
    TAKERU: "Late for what?"
    NATSUMI: "An hour after class, meet me by the back entrance, near the fields."
    TAKERU: "Is this some kind of trap?"
    She's useless at concealing anything. While she's trying to pretend to pay attention to Meiko's talk, she's still grinning.
    Definitely up to something.
    TAKERU: "I still haven't forgiven you for chucking that book at me, you know. You have a couple rocks you're going to throw at me this time?"
    NATSUMI: "Shhh. You should be paying attention to Meiko."
    As if to punctuate her point, she raises her hand.
    MEIKO: "So submit your expenses before - "
    MEIKO: "Natsumi? You've got a festival budget question?"
    NASTUMI: "Just a festival question in general I guess. The fireworks are still happening this year, right?"
    Meiko makes an unreadable expression before returning to a grim neutral.
    MEIKO: "No. Cancelled. Administration said so. Nothing's changed since last time you asked."
    There are a few groans from the surrounding students, but Meiko talks over them. Guess she's not done.
    TAKERU: "What's this about fireworks?"
    NATSUMI: "It's a tradition at Mirako, you know. Our school festival always ends with fireworks."
    NATSUMI: "That's the reason have the people from town attend. Plus it's like the mistletoe of summer."
    TAKERU: "Mistletoe?"
    NASTUMI: "They say there's nothing more romantic than that moment under the sky when the fireworks hit their finale."
    She stops watching Meiko to turn to me.
    NATSUMI: "...if you've got someone special in mind."
    TAKERU: "That's a terrible face you're making."
    NATSUMI: "You can at least humor me a little."
    TAKERU: "Whatever. Why are they cancelled?"
    NATSUMI: "There was fire on festival night last year. The fireworks were over and done with, and they found the fire wasn't even related, but I guess it spooked the administration."
    NATSUMI: "So no fireworks."
    TAKERU: "Too bad."
    NATSUMI: "I wish the rest of the old wing would burn down, then maybe we could get that crypt remodeled as well."
    With all the talking Meiko does about the festival, you'd think this whole thing would've come up earlier.
    TAKERU: "Oh well, guess it's time for class."
    NASTUMI: "See you later. And don't forget after school, okay?"
    TAKERU: "Fine but don't you dare throw me anything."

    I drag my head out from under my pillow. There's something wrong this morning.
    I'm tired, I was up to all hours last night, but that's not it...
    Kenta's shuffling around somewhere by the door.
    Wait. If Kenta's already awake... why hasn't he attacked me yet?
    TAKERU: "Kenta... Kenta what time is it?"
    KENTA: "Good morning, Takeru. Good morning!"
    TAKERU: "Good morning. What's got you all worked up?"
    I check my alarm. There's no jars in the way for once, but...
    Why is the display blank?
    TAKERU: "Oh no... It must've gotten unplugged yesterday when we were moving things around."
    KENTA: "I tried to wake you up but you but nothing worked."
    TAKERU: "Did you try calling me? Or maybe grabbing my shoulder or something?"
    KENTA: "No."
    KENTA: "I tapped you a few times but... it didn't work."
    Thank you, pillow, for saving me from Kenta's onslaught. Except...
    Kenta's dressed. He's practically out the door already.
    TAKERU: "It's late, isn't it?"
    KENTA: "Really late."
    TAKERU: "Okay, sorry, sorry, give me five minutes."
    I start throwing open drawers to find my clothes but of course only Kenta knows where anything is kept in this godforsaken room, and he's too busy checking his watch and fidgeting to help.
    In retrospect it was a terrible mistake to dig out all of my old Tohoku stuff last night. I'm not even out the door before I'm feeling drowsy.
    Kenta's practically running up the hill road, and it's all I can do to keep up. Looks like we actually might be late for once. At least the cold air might wake me up.
    
    I make the start of homeroom by the skin of my teeth.
    Looks like Meiko's already given her talk, and everyone else is here but the teacher, except for - 
    NATSUMI: "Heya Takeru."
    Natsumi sits down two seconds before I can take my seat.
    NATSUMI: "You're pretty late. Not quite enough to be a delinquent, but, keep up the good work."
    TAKERU: "I don't need to hear that from you."
    NATSUMI: "I ran morning practice today. What's your excuse?"
    TAKERU: "Er..."
    I'm trying to figure out how to explain the frogs, the furniture, and the roommate that make up the warzone of my dorm, but it's too early and I really don't want to talk to Natsumi.
    TAKERU: "Long story."
    NATSUMI: "Were you spying on our practice? You know, you're welcome to join at - "
    TAKERU: "Not interested. No way."
    It seems Meiko didn't talk Natsumi out of this hairbrained recruitment scam. But I don't know why I thought she would. She started this, after all.
    NATSUMI: "And who gave you that black eye?"
    TAKERU: "A piece of wood."
    NATSUMI: "A piece of wood wielded by a hooligan who attacked you last night on your way home from - "
    TAKERU: "A piece of wood wielded by a piece of furniture."
    NATSUMI: "Come on, Takeru, that was your chance to brag. I'm not sure I want a pitcher who even gets beat up by inanimate objects."
    TAKERU: "Good, go find some other guy and leave me alone."
    NATSUMI: "You're no fun this morning."
    I don't want to be fun. I just want to survive a few classes without passing out at my desk. Looks like that might take a miracle.
    A desk over, Meiko just silently watches Natsumi's repeated failure to start a conversation with me.
    I don't really want to dwell on Meiko now either. Just looking at her reminds me of those letters, and that hyperrealistic memory of the younger Meiko writing them. A memory I probably shouldn't have in the first place, when I think about it.
    It really was the strangest thing. I could've sworn I was there, that I saw those events in person. When I close my eyes I almost see it again. There were no details, no real colors, but everything was just... familiar.
    I must've drifted off. When I open my eyes, I'm still drowsy and it looks as if half the room has taken on that vivid-yet-colorless quality.
    For instance... Meiko's hair is a deep brown. But I can't see it. I just remember it that way.
    MEIKO: "...but you should still have a chance, if you work hard."
    NATSUMI: "We're underdogs, for sure. But there's always a chance. Especially if my secret plan goes through."
    MEIKO: "Good luck then. Let me know if there's anything I can do for you, if you need help with classes in the meantime, or anything like that."
    NATSUMI: "Oh I don't care about class much. The tournament's way more important at this point. Just worry about your pet festival."
    At least they're talking again. That's one more piece of life back to normal.
    I must be really tired. This whole morning just feels abnormal, to the extreme. Like I've already finished this day once and I'm watching the rerun.

label day04:

    I wake up to a sharp rap on the forehead.
    KENTA: "Hello. We're behind schedule."
    TAKERU: "I'm awake, I'm awake!"
    Beats waking up to spiders, I guess.
    I navigate Kenta's organizational systems and, prep for school, and fly through the morning routine. Almost out the door, and - 
    TAKERU: "Wait a second."
    KENTA: "We'll be late."
    TAKERU: "Kenta, hold on, we've got plenty of time."
    I almost forgot my pills.
    Two every morning. It's a small price to pay for "never again."
    Granted on Sunday they didn't exactly do their job. At least I don't think.
    But I'll be far worse without them. I remember a few of those nights in the ward.
    Kenta is waiting outside, his eyes fixed on his wrist where a watch would go.
    KENTA: "Are you ready to go?"
    TAKERU: "Yeah, let's head out."
    
    The beginning of the day passes as usual.
    Natsumi arrives in the nick of time. Meiko has some remarks for the class (does she seriously do this every day?)
    Only after the end of the first class does it feel like things ever slow down this morning.
    MEIKO: "Natsumi, wake up. If you zone out during class I'm not giving you my notes."
    NATSUMI: "Yeah you will... You're too nice."
    MEIKO: "I can be strict if I want. Why are you so tired anyway?"
    NATSUMI: "Regionals are coming up. I run practices a bit longer before big tournaments."
    TAKERU: "Sounds rough."
    MEIKO: "What, Takeru, isn't that normal? I remember you always wearing out your arm before a big game."
    NATSUMI: "Oh yeah, you play baseball after all?"
    I try to signal to Meiko. I think she catches what I mean by the look in my eye, but...
    MEIKO: "Takeru is quite talented. His pitching even got him a scholar - "
    TAKERU: "No, I don't play baseball."
    Natsumi looks more confused than Meiko. Can I really hide this any longer? Is it worth trying? This can only open up awkward questions that I'm in no shape to answer.
    MEIKO: "Takeru, don't you - "
    TAKERU: "I don't play any more."
    NATSUMI: "Wait."
    An insidious smile takes over Natsumi's face and she jabs a finger at my chest.
    NATSUMI: "You said you transferred from Tohoku, right?"
    TAKERU: "I don't remember saying that..."
    MEIKO: "He did."
    NATSUMI: "You're telling me you got scouted by Tohoku? And they offered to have you come play?"
    TAKERU: "They were optimistic. I got there and I played like garbage."
    MEIKO: "Oh..."
    TAKERU: "Why else would I be here and not there?"
    NATSUMI: "Dunno. I kind of assumed you had, y'know..."
    TAKERU: "Mental problems? Thanks."
    NATSUMI: "Not that there's anything wrong with that! Mirako's a great place, you know."
    NATSUMI: "You were what, a pitcher? What's your top MPH?"
    TAKERU: "Zero MPH."
    NATSUMI: "Oh come on... This could be a big thing."
    I would've thought she'd be able to figure out by now I'm not comfortable with this. For her part, Meiko just watches.
    Slowly though, Natsumi slides back in her chair.
    NATSUMI: "Fine, fine..."
    She's still giving me a look though. Sort of a side-eye stare.
    MEIKO: "I take you haven't joined the baseball team then."
    TAKERU: "No. I'm retired. I'd rather not bring it up."
    MEIKO: "Sorry if I inconvenienced you."
    TAKERU: "No, no, I shouldn't be so touchy about it. You were just trying to be helpful."
    NATSUMI: "..."
    Please stop looking at me like that Natsumi.
    TAKERU: "I haven't joined anything yet and I probably won't for a while."
    MEIKO: "That's a shame. Why not?"
    TAKERU: "I'm still just trying to get used to Mirako. I don't think I need any other distractions."
    MEIKO: "Sometimes distractions are all we've got."
    TAKERU: "Not ones with bad associations."
    MEIKO: "Bad associations..."
    MEIKO: "Well, you adapt however you need to, and let me know if I can help. Just remember I've always got your back, Takeru."
    Meiko beams.
    NATSUMI: "Cuuute."
    TAKERU: "Oh be quiet."
    I get the feeling there's a conspiracy here, and I'm not really looking forward to where it leads.
    But maybe Meiko is right and what I need is a distraction.
    
    That's still what's on my mind as I leave the classroom for lunch.
    Should I head up to the old library? Probably not. After that awkward exit yesterday my bet is Hagami would prefer if I weren't constantly hanging around. Probably Mana too.
    KENTA: "Hello Takeru."
    TAKERU: "Ah, hey Kenta. Are you headed somewhere for lunch?"
    KENTA: "Possibly."
    I still haven't actually grabbed lunch with this guy.
    TAKERU: "Maybe we could..."
    KENTA: "...Could what? It's rude to end your sentences in the middle you know. It can make people very confused."
    There's someone over his shoulder. Staring at me.
    HAGAMI: "..."
    TAKERU: "Hi Hagami?"
    KENTA: "Are you talking to me? Did you call me something? You're very strange today."
    I gesture for him to turn around.
    KENTA: "Oh, it's you. Hello. I forget your name again. Sorry. I'm Kenta."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    KENTA: "That's very rude, you know. I'm introducing myself. I think you reply with your name."
    HAGAMI: "..."
    Hagami looks like she's concentrating. Her gaze narrows into a glare. Is she sweating? Should I interrupt?
    HAGAMI: "...Hagami."
    KENTA: "Could you speak up?"
    TAKERU: "She said her name's Hagami."
    KENTA: "Takeru it's impolite to speak for other people. Why doesn't she talk? Did I snub her or something?"
    TAKERU: "Leave her alone Kenta. Hagami, is there something you needed?"
    Hagami looks at me, then at Kenta. She's not glaring any more. Actually, as I watch, her eyes open in... fear?
    She turns around and walks down the hall.
    KENTA: "She's always like that."
    TAKERU: "You know her?"
    KENTA: "She's in my class. Not that she ever talks to me, or to half of the teachers. Some people just have very poor manners."
    KENTA: "I've heard her speak though, so I don't understand why she can't give me the same courtesy."
    TAKERU: "I guess..."
    KENTA: "Goodbye."
    TAKERU: "That was abrupt. Is there somewhere you need to..."
    But then I see the reason why.
    NATSUMI: "Heya."
    TAKERU: "Oh. Hey. Sorry if I snapped at you in class. I didn't mean to... I guess it was just sudden. But I'm not up for talking baseball."
    NATSUMI: "No worries."
    She's got that smile again though.
    NATSUMI: "I heard from a certain someone you're staying late to study for chem, right?"

label Day2:

    "Thump!"
    "I can feel it on my head again."
    "It's the same as yesterday."
    "Thump!"
    "Alright, alright I'm up, stop that already!"
    "I swing my body upright to make sure Kenta knows I'm definitely awake."
    k"Good morning."
    "I quickly glance at my bedside table just to realise I slept for way longer than I should've."
    "I mentally kick myself for not remembering to set an alarm."
    "In a drowsy half-slumber I get the sheets off of me so I can start getting ready."
    "Just starting to feel conscious now I finally take in the entire room around me."
    "It still doesn't feel like a home that I can call my own."
    "But now that I think about it, it's not like there's a place like that for me anywhere."
    "At least not anymore."
    "I'll just have to accept this and move on, there's nothing else I can do."
    "In a way it's the closest place I have to being a home at the moment."
    "I live here and most of my close belongings are here too."
    "I spend a few minutes getting dressed and packing my bag."
    "I suppose I've still got plenty of time for breakfast so I won't skip it today."

    "Again, Kenta and I walk together to school, though we aren't late like last time."

    "As we walk I see a girl, just standing by herself in the middle of the street."
    "It's hard to tell from this distance but it looks like she has a piece of paper out."
    "And she's searching the surrounding area for something."
    "Maybe it's a photo?"
    "Actually, she's wearing our uniform too."
    "I'm a little interested, I wonder what she's doing."
    "I catch myself staring at her when I feel someone poking my shoulder."

    a"Hmm?"
    k"You seemed to have spaced out so I tried to push the un-space out button."
    "He doesn't mean my shoulder does he?"
    "..."
    a"Kenta, do you see that girl just over there?"
    with dissolve

    k"Oh, she looks like someone from our school."
    k"I don't recognise her."
    k"She might be a second year?"
    a"Yeah maybe, but she looks confused about something don't you think?"
    k"Why don't you go over and help her?"
    a"Huh? Oh me?"
    k"Who else?"
    a"I thought it'd be better if you went..."
    "I hate to admit it but going up to a girl I don't know alone in the street isn't something I'm the most comfortable with."
    "She might get the wrong idea."
    "Though now that I think about it, it might be even worse with Kenta..."
    k"Whatever, come on you have to man up."
    k"I'll be right behind you if you're worried about looking like a creep."
    a"Did you just call me a creep? Do I look like one?"

    c"Excuse me, you look like you're in the same school as me..."
    "Just as I was bickering with Kenta the strange girl initiates the conversation instead."
    "We were so preoccupied we didn't even notice her coming toward us."
    "The girl was obviously referring to the school emblem we both had on our uniform."
    k"Oh. Yeah that's right we're wearing the same uniform."
    a"Did you need something?"
    c"Yeah I do actually. I'm new to the school, I've just transferred but I'm having trouble with finding it."
    c"I've made it this far by reading this map."
    c"But as you can probably tell I'm not too good at reading maps."
    "She's definitely right, after checking her map she's not even on the route the map shows her to go."
    "Both Kenta and I look over the map but neither of us respond to the girl for what has become an uncomfortable amount of time."
    a"Don't worry about it, we're heading there right now so you can come with us."
    "Even though I'm new, I still know enough of the way to school."
    "Eventually I decide we should help her. I wish Kenta had spoken up sooner, but I guess this situation is up to me."
    c"Thank you! I don't know what I would've done if you two hadn't come along!"
    a"That's fine, it's not like you're putting us out of our way or anything."
    c"Can I ask what your names' are? I'm Kunikada Setsuko."
    a"Ichiro Takeru."
    k"Satou Kenta."

    "For the rest of the walk she trails slightly behind us without speaking, she doesn't seem all that shy though."
    "It seems weird to me but it's not like a mind at all."

    "As I notice a few students, though I recognise none, I remember the girl who I saw around here the other day."
    "I still can't remember her name, or who she exactly is."
    "She looked like a student from our school so I'm sure I'll see her again, at least once."
    "In any case I don't end up seeing her this morning on the way to school."



    "I get to class a little early today, trying to counteract my tardiness of yesterday."
    "Natsumi walks in just as the bell rings and smiles at me as she sits at her desk."
    "It's not long before homeroom starts as the teacher begins to prepare his morning announcements."
    "The class rep, who I still don't know the name of, stands and addresses the class before the teacher begins."

    "The roll is called, meaning it's time to zone out for the rest of homeroom."
    "These announcements are usually meaningless, or only important for a few students who are active in school activities."
    "Not being one of those people yet, I sit here, just staring out the window."
    "Wait, I can hear people muttering about something..."
    "Did I miss something important?"
    t"...we will be welcoming a new transfer student today so please make her feel at home."
    stb"What? Another transfer student!"
    sta"Two in a row?!"
    stb"That's a little strange isn't it?"
    "The class seems less interested in her and more interested in the timing of her transfer."
    "There were discussions occurring everywhere in the class right now after hearing this news."
    "Wait a moment, that girl I met this morning... didn't she say she was new?"
    "It can't be... can it?"
    t"Quieten down class, we need to give our new student a chance to introduce herself."
    "And at that moment the new girl entered the classroom."

    "This girl has an average height, long flowing dark hair and blue eyes, she wears a purple ribbon on her uniform and in her hair. Her expression is content rather than fearful or embarrassed."
    "A lot of the guys in the class are excited to see it's a girl transferring, probably because most of them would already have a certain reputation with the girls here."
    "The girls are excited too but probably for more respectable reasons."
    "After the class settles down the atmosphere is set for her to introduce herself, she doesn't seem afraid at all by the thirty or so students staring at her, waiting for her to speak."
    "The strange girl stands still patiently awaiting the class, until taking a short breath in preparation to speak."
    c"My name is Kunikada Setsuko."
    "It was unmistakably her, the girl I met this morning."
    "Her voice was soft, but not quiet, everyone heard her words."
    "The class seemed a little surprised with such a blunt introduction, nothing more than her name"
    "I can still say it was a step up from mine."
    "Usually students would add a little more to their introduction when coming into a school for the first time."
    t"Kunikada, is there anything else you'd like to add? Such as your hobbies or where you came from?"
    "The teacher tries to help the girl out of this awkward situation just like he did for me."
    c"I just moved here, my Dad's work brought him to this town and as a result brought me too, so I'm pleased to meet you all!"
    "Luckily she handled the situation quite well in comparison to myself."
    t"Alright class, make sure you make Kunikada feel welcome. You may take your seat now, Kunikada."

    "Kunikada searches for a moment for her seat, she finds the only seat left. The one next to mine."
    "As she walks toward her desk I notice her face, it's quickly growing paler and paler."
    "Then her eyelids, they're beginning to shut."
    "Her hand reaches for the desk beside her."
    "But her knees wobble as she takes the next step."
    "Her body topples toward me."
    "Times seems to slow down around me."
    "Bracing for the impact with no time to think, I hold both arms out in an attempt to catch her."
    "She gracefully lands unharmed within my arms."
    "Her body is a lot softer and lighter than I had expected."
    "The rest of the class turn their heads to see what the noise is in my corner of the classroom."
    "And all they see is me, holding the transfer student half a metre from the ground."
    a"Are you alright?"
    "The girl infront of me gives a slight nod and tries to move her legs."
    t"Ichiro, please take Kunikada to the infirmary immediately."
    "I could feel my face growing red."
    a"Can you stand?"
    "Kunikada nods again and tries to move upright with my help."

    "I grab her arm and put it around my neck to support her weight as we walk out of the classroom into the empty hall."
    "As we walk it seems her condition is improving."
    "She's slowly leaning on me less and less, trying to bear her own weight."
    c"Sorry about this."
    "She tries to speak, this time with a voice much softer than before."
    c"It only happens every once and while."
    c"I have a condition that sometimes makes me unexplainably feel nauseous for a few moments, usually I end up fainting and falling to the floor."
    c"So thanks for catching me."
    a"Don't worry about it, you were falling toward me anyway so it's not like I could just step out of your way."
    c"You'd be surpised."
    a"Surpised by what?"
    c"This is the first time I've fallen, that hasn't resulted in a bruised or bleeding face."
    c"So thanks for that."
    "We reached the stairs, the infirmary is located on the 1st floor."
    "We're currently on the third."
    a"Do you think you can manage?"
    c"Yeah, I think so."
    "This time Kunikada holds me tightly as we descend the stairs."
    "We stop to rest at the end of each set."
    "She still seems so fragile and weak."
    "Luckily we just need to get to the beds in the infirmary."
    "And it was right infront of us, we'd reached the 1st floor."
    c"It's ok, I know I seem pretty faint right now."
    c"But I always get better within an hour or two."
    c"I should be back by fourth period."
    a"Sounds good. I'll see you then."

    "The rest of class is uneventful, the same as always."
    "However halfway through fourth period Kunikada re-enters the classroom."
    t"Welcome back Kunikada."
    "Without instruction, Kunikada heads straight for her seat and sits down, trying to avoid any more attention from the other members of the class."

    with dissolve

    "I found myself constantly checking Kunikada throughout the class, I guess I'm still worried that she might drop out onto her desk at any moment."
    "But she never does and soon enough the bell rings signaling the end of class."

    "Where should I sit for lunch?"
    "Maybe I should eat lunch with Mana and Hagami?"
    "I did agree to visiting again sometime."
    "It's not like there are many other options anyway."
    "I head in the clubroom's direction while weaving my way through the mass of hungry students heading to the cafeteria in the opposite direction."
    "Turning around the corner something hits me with running speed."
    "I can't help but fall backwards, landing hard on the floor."
    a"Owwwwww"
    "Paper fills my vision. There's a lot of it. Floating in the air. On the floor."
    "Crap, I've run into someone."
    "At my feet is a girl frantically grabbing the papers that are all over the floor. She must have been in a hurry."
    a"Are you all right?"
    b"Yes! I'm fine!"
    "She continues to grab papers like her life depends on it."
    "I begin grabbing papers out of the air. Judging by what's on them the order was important. I've created a lot of hassle by not looking where I was going."
    "I squat down to hand my collected paper back to her."
    b"Thanks for the help."
    b"And sorry for run-"
    "We make eye contact."
    "She looks up at me with a widened gaze as he mouth opens slightly."
    b"I-Ichiro? Is that you?"
    "It's the girl from earlier."
    "And I know who she is now."
    "Memories begin to flood back as I recall who it is in front of me."
    "Kotaru Meiko."
    "My childhood friend for eight years."
    "Though I haven't spoken to her in a long time..."
    "My fresh start looks almost impossible now."
    "Damn."
    "Five years of walking to school with her. She's knows almost everything about me."
    "Damn."
    "Same primary school, but I haven't really spoken to her since she left my middle school."
    "Damn."
    "I've been staring at her for a while now. I don't really know where to start."
    "I haven't seen her since she was little, so it's a little hard to tell.
    "But I can still see it's her... Despite her developments."
    "She grabs the papers from me and rockets upright."
    "Her hands go to her hair."
    "I don't have time for this right now! Aargh!"
    "She turns away from me for a moment."
    "When she turns back her eyes are intense."
    "Takeru! It's great to see you again! We have a whole bunch of catching up to do! Take these."
    "She thrusts the paper's towards me. I'm not ready for this and they slam into my chest. I wrap my arms around them as she lets go, saving us from picking them up all over again."
    "I need you to take these to the student council room. Right now! At once! A.S.A.P.!
    "She nods to herself and bolts off."
    a"Meiko! I- what?"
    "She's gone."
    "I don't know where to find the student council room."
    "Back to square one."

    "She seemed like she was in a big hurry when she bumped into me."
    "So these papers must be important, a high priority."
    "Well I wasn't really doing much else this lunch anyways."
    "She certainly didn't leave any time for a formal request though."
    "I sigh but ultimately walk with the papers in a random direction."

    "After around ten minutes of searching aimlessly I still have no idea where the student council room could be."
    "I've narrowed it down though."
    "It's somewhere within the school boundaries..."
    "That really doesn't help though does it?"
    "My stomach rumbles as I begin to realise I still haven't eaten anything yet."
    "Five minutes to eat something can't hurt my search too much..."
    "I find a quiet spot in the courtyard, surrounded by the school's natural greenery."
    "It's a nice spot, but for whatever reason not many people are sitting around here."
    "Halfway through eating the sandwich I prepared this morning, I notice a girl walking past me."
    "Wait is that Hikari?"
    "I stand up to go ask her about the student council room."
    "But the moment I stand she's already gone."
    "Where could she have gone?"
    "After a moment of thought an idea comes to me."
    "That empty room with the tea set!"
    "I'd never admit it but she scares me a little."
    "It could just be how cold she seemed, but something tells me that there's more to it than that."
    "But she helped me last time I was lost, I'm sure she can do it again."
    "Suppressing a slight shiver, I run off."

    "I have no idea how lunch ended up this way, but before I know it I'm standing in front of the old door."
    "My hand trembles a little as I push the door open."
    "I sheepishly make my way into the dark room."
    "The exact same scene as last time presents itself."
    "I take a moment to scan the chairs for Hikari."
    "I triple check the chair that she was sitting in last time."
    "But nobody is there."
    "In the end I was wrong to think she'd be here."
    "After all, there's no way she'd be here 24/7."
    "I'm not giving up just yet though."
    "Once again I go over to open the curtains."
    "Light floods into every corner of the room."
    "I give a start when a silver strand comes into the edge of my vision."
    "It's Hikari, and she's in the exact same spot as last time."
    "The spot that I was sure was empty a minute ago.
    "Something stirs in my chest."
    "It feels somewhat akin to fear."
    a"Uh, hey, I didn't see you there."
    i"?!!?!?"
    "Her head snaps back and in instant her bulging violet irises are staring into mine."
    i"Wha-how, di-didn't we meet yesterday?"
    "I almost laugh out loud at the look of shock on her face but I manage to reign it in at the very last second."
    "I don't want her to think I'm insulting her."
    a"Yeah, Hikari was it?"
    "Mouth still half hanging open, she gives a small nod of affirmation."
    a"Sorry I startled you, are you ok?"
    i"Ye-Yes."
    "Her mouth is finally closed, but her eyes still hold a shocked, almost manic look."
    a"Oh, I never introduced myself did I? I'm Ichiro Takeru, pleased to make your acquaintance."
    "That probably sounded really stupid, but I'm desperately trying to put her at ease."
    "For a second I could have sworn I saw her mouth upturn."
    "But it's gone in an instant."
    "Furthermore she seems to have somewhat recovered her stoic look from before."
    "But I can still see something in her eyes."
    "Is that...excitement?"
    i"He-hello Ichiro."
    a"Hey, may I sit down?"
    i"Please."
    "She gestures to the seat across from hers and leans back into her chair."
    "I can tell that she's desperately trying to hold back a torrent of questions."
    "But about what?"
    "
   
    
    "Wait, where did that come from?"
    "It's like she pulled it out of nowhere."
    "It's got a special scent to it."
    "Morning Glorys?"
    a"Is that a map of the school?"
    "She gives another almost imperceptible nod."
    a"Thanks, I'll be right back!"
    "I give the most comforting smile I can muster and walk out the door."
    "From the looks of things it didn't help much."
    i"Uh-uhm, I-I'll see you later!"
    "I pause in my step and a small grin appears on my face."
    a"Yeah, you definitely will!"
    "I shout back at her as I look back to the map."
    "There's no doubt about it, that sweet scent belongs to a Morning Glory."
    "A slight shiver passes down my spine."
    "I have no idea if it's pleasant or nauseating."
    "There's something strange about all this."
    "Oh well, I can deal with it later."
    "For now I have to deliver these papers for...Meiko."
    "Damn it."

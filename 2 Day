  "Thump!"
  "I can feel it on my head again."
  "It's the same as yesterday."
  "Thump!"
  "Alright, alright I'm up, stop that already!"
  "I swing my body upright to make sure Kenta knows I'm definitely awake."
  k"Good morning."
  "I quickly glance at my bedside table just to realise I slept for way longer than I should've."
  "I mentally kick myself for not remembering to set an alarm."
  "In a drowsy half-slumber I get the sheets off of me so I can start getting ready."
  "Just starting to feel conscious now I finally take in the entire room around me."
  "It still doesn't feel like a home that I can call my own."
  "But now that I think about it, it's not like there's a place like that for me anywhere."
  "At least not anymore."
  "I'll just have to accept this and move on, there's nothing else I can do."
  "In a way it's the closest place I have to being a home at the moment."
  "I live here and most of my close belongings are here too."
  "I spend a few minutes getting dressed and packing my bag."
  I suppose I've still got plenty of time for breakfast so I won't skip it today."

  "Again, Kenta and I walk together to school, though we aren't late like last time."

  "As we walk I see a girl, just standing by herself in the middle of the street."
  "It's hard to tell from this distance but it looks like she has a piece of paper out."
  "And she's searching the surrounding area for something."
  "Maybe it's a photo?"
  "Actually, she's wearing our uniform too."
  "I'm a little interested, I wonder what she's doing."
  "I catch myself staring at her when I feel someone poking my shoulder."

  a"Hmm?"
  k"You seemed to have spaced out so I tried to push the un-space out button."
  "He doesn't mean my shoulder does he?"
  "..."
  a"Kenta, do you see that girl just over there?"
  with dissolve

  k"Oh, she looks like someone from our school."
  k"I don't recognise her."
  k"She might be a second year?"
  a"Yeah maybe, but she looks confused about something don't you think?"
  k"Why don't you go over and help her?"
  a"Huh? Oh me?"
  k"Who else?"
  a"I thought it'd be better if you went..."
  "I hate to admit it but going up to a girl I don't know alone in the street isn't something I'm the most comfortable with."
  "She might get the wrong idea."
  "Though now that I think about it, it might be even worse with Kenta..."
  k"Whatever, come on you have to man up."
  k"I'll be right behind you if you're worried about looking like a creep."
  a"Did you just call me a creep? Do I look like one?"

  c"Excuse me, you look like you're in the same school as me..."
  "Just as I was bickering with Kenta the strange girl initiates the conversation instead."
  "We were so preoccupied we didn't even notice her coming toward us."
  "The girl was obviously referring to the school emblem we both had on our uniform."
  k"Oh. Yeah that's right we're wearing the same uniform."
  a"Did you need something?"
  c"Yeah I do actually. I'm new to the school, I've just transferred but I'm having trouble with finding it."
  c"I've made it this far by reading this map."
  c"But as you can probably tell I'm not too good at reading maps."
  "She's definitely right, after checking her map she's not even on the route the map shows her to go."
  "Both Kenta and I look over the map but neither of us respond to the girl for what has become an uncomfortable amount of time."
  a"Don't worry about it, we're heading there right now so you can come with us."
  "Even though I'm new, I still know enough of the way to school."
  "Eventually I decide we should help her. I wish Kenta had spoken up sooner, but I guess this situation is up to me."
  c"Thank you! I don't know what I would've done if you two hadn't come along!"
  a"That's fine, it's not like you're putting us out of our way or anything."
  c"Can I ask what your names' are? I'm Kunikada Setsuko."
  a"Ichiro Takeru."
  k"Satou Kenta."

  "For the rest of the walk she trails slightly behind us without speaking, she doesn't seem all that shy though."
  "It seems weird to me but it's not like a mind at all."

  "As I notice a few students, though I recognise none, I remember the girl who I saw around here the other day."
  "I still can't remember her name, or who she exactly is."
  "She looked like a student from our school so I'm sure I'll see her again, at least once."
  "In any case I don't end up seeing her this morning on the way to school."



  "I get to class a little early today, trying to counteract my tardiness of yesterday."
  "Natsumi walks in just as the bell rings and smiles at me as she sits at her desk."
  "It's not long before homeroom starts as the teacher begins to prepare his morning announcements."
  "The class rep, who I still don't know the name of, stands and addresses the class before the teacher begins."

  "The roll is called, meaning it's time to zone out for the rest of homeroom."
  "These announcements are usually meaningless, or only important for a few students who are active in school activities."
  "Not being one of those people yet, I sit here, just staring out the window."
  "Wait, I can hear people muttering about something..."
  "Did I miss something important?"
  t"...we will be welcoming a new transfer student today so please make her feel at home."
  e"What? Another transfer student!"
  h"Two in a row?!"
  e"That's a little strange isn't it?"
  "The class seems less interested in her and more interested in the timing of her transfer."
  "There were discussions occurring everywhere in the class right now after hearing this news."
  "Wait a moment, that girl I met this morning... didn't she say she was new?"
  "It can't be... can it?"
  t"Quieten down class, we need to give our new student a chance to introduce herself."
  "And at that moment the new girl entered the classroom."

  "This girl has an average height, long flowing dark hair and blue eyes, she wears a purple ribbon on her uniform and in her hair. Her expression is content rather than fearful or embarrassed."
  "A lot of the guys in the class are excited to see it's a girl transferring, probably because most of them would already have a certain reputation with the girls here."
  "The girls are excited too but probably for more respectable reasons."
  "After the class settles down the atmosphere is set for her to introduce herself, she doesn't seem afraid at all by the thirty or so students staring at her, waiting for her to speak."
  "The strange girl stands still patiently awaiting the class, until taking a short breath in preparation to speak."
  c"My name is Kunikada Setsuko."
  "It was unmistakably her, the girl I met this morning."
  "Her voice was soft, but not quiet, everyone heard her words."
  "The class seemed a little surprised with such a blunt introduction, nothing more than her name"
  "I can still say it was a step up from mine."
  "Usually students would add a little more to their introduction when coming into a school for the first time."
  t"Kunikada, is there anything else you'd like to add? Such as your hobbies or where you came from?"
  "The teacher tries to help the girl out of this awkward situation just like he did for me."
  c"I just moved here, my Dad's work brought him to this town and as a result brought me too, so I'm pleased to meet you all!"
  "Luckily she handled the situation quite well in comparison to myself."
  t"Alright class, make sure you make Kunikada feel welcome. You may take your seat now, Kunikada."

  "Kunikada searches for a moment for her seat, she finds the only seat left. The one next to mine."
  "As she walks toward her desk I notice her face, it's quickly growing paler and paler."
  "Then her eyelids, they're beginning to shut."
  "Her hand reaches for the desk beside her."
  "But her knees wobble as she takes the next step."
  "Her body topples toward me."
  "Times seems to slow down around me."
  "Bracing for the impact with no time to think, I hold both arms out in an attempt to catch her."
  "She gracefully lands unharmed within my arms."
  "Her body is a lot softer and lighter than I had expected."
  "The rest of the class turn their heads to see what the noise is in my corner of the classroom."
  "And all they see is me, holding the transfer student half a metre from the ground."
  a"Are you alright?"
  "The girl infront of me gives a slight nod and tries to move her legs."
  f"Ichiro, please take Kunikada to the infirmary immediately."
  "I could feel my face growing red."
  a"Can you stand?"
  "Kunikada nods again and tries to move upright with my help."

  "I grab her arm and put it around my neck to support her weight as we walk out of the classroom into the empty hall."
  "As we walk it seems her condition is improving."
  "She's slowly leaning on me less and less, trying to bear her own weight."
  c"Sorry about this."
  "She tries to speak, this time with a voice much softer than before."
  c"It only happens every once and while."
  c"I have a condition that sometimes makes me unexplainably feel nauseous for a few moments, usually I end up fainting and falling to the floor."
  c"So thanks for catching me."
  a"Don't worry about it, you were falling toward me anyway so it's not like I could just step out of your way."
  c"You'd be surpised."
  a"Surpised by what?"
  c"This is the first time I've fallen, that hasn't resulted in a bruised or bleeding face."
  c"So thanks for that."
  "We reached the stairs, the infirmary is located on the 1st floor."
  "We're currently on the third."
  a"Do you think you can manage?"
  c"Yeah, I think so."
  "This time Kunikada holds me tightly as we descend the stairs."
  "We stop to rest at the end of each set."
  "She still seems so fragile and weak."
  "Luckily we just need to get to the beds in the infirmary."
  "And it was right infront of us, we'd reached the 1st floor."
  c"It's ok, I know I seem pretty faint right now."
  c"But I always get better within an hour or two."
  c"I should be back by fourth period."
  a"Sounds good. I'll see you then."

  "The rest of class is uneventful, the same as always."
  "However halfway through fourth period Kunikada re-enters the classroom."
  f"Welcome back Kunikada."
  "Without instruction, Kunikada heads straight for her seat and sits down, trying to avoid any more attention from the other members of the class."

  "I found myself constantly checking Kunikada throughout the class, I guess I'm still worried that she might drop out onto her desk at any moment."
  "But she never does and soon enough the bell rings signalling the end of class."

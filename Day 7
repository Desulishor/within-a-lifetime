    c"I told them she would pay for most of her own things with her job while living at my place."
    c"So they agreed to let her use the spare room."
    c"However they were a little reluctant at letting a stranger becoming a pseudo-family member."
    c"So they said if Maeko did anything to harm my family or the house she would be kicked out immediately."

    "Hopefully Maeko made it to school today."
    "She's almost always early for school when she does come."
    "After walking for a small while in school Setsuko becomes confused."
    c"Do you know where Maeko could be?"
    "She usually heads to either the library or her clubroom at the start of the school."
    "She belongs to the Literature club so either place is a good spot to read before school starts."

    "The library is almost empty, after a quick search we don't find any sign of her."
    a"Ok the only other place I can think of is the Literature Clubroom."
    "Going down the hallway I notice a strange red-haired girl I'd never seen before. She looked to be around the same age as me."
    "It's not too unusual to see someone you don't know in a school as large as ours but still."
    "This girl was obviously staring at me."
    "Setsuko must've noticed also, it was too hard not to notice."
    "We both felt the same way and kept walking, avoiding eye contact."
    
    "Do I know her...? I don't think so."
    "Surely she wasn't someone I met in that time gap/skip that I have no memories of."
    "It's probably not important, and I already have something to do that is important."
    
    "The literature club's activities are mostly carried out in this room, the Geography and History book storage room."
    "We've reached our destination."
    c"Is this it?"
    a"Yeah this is the literature clubroom."
    c"No I mean is THIS it... It's kinda small you know?"
    a"Well yeah, it doesn't have many members in it. I think including Maeko there are three."
    c"Huh? More than just Maeko?"
    a"Of course, it's not like she doesn't have any friends."
    c"Hey, I didn't say that!."
    "Something tells me she meant it."
    c"So who are they then, I don't really see Maeko talking to people much in class."
    a"That's because they're not in our class, or year even."
    a"I'm not sure what class they're in but I know they're both first years."
    
    a"From what I remember from what Maeko has told me there used to be more members but they've all graduated now."
    a"The school's policy is once a club is formed with four people it can run for as long as it still has at least one member."
    
    a"I think their names were... Chiyada and Na... natsuki? No that's not right... Natsugi?"
    k"You mean Natsumi."
    "Wait, that wasn't Setsuko who said that was it."
    "I turned around to see a red haired girl with shiny golden eyes, the same one who was watching me earlier down the hallway."
    a"Woah, uh. Sorry about that Natsumi, I'm not too good at remembering things, especially names."
    k"You're too cruel Ichiro, but I'll forgive you this time."
    "Natsumi wasn't one who was particularly interested in respecting her elders."
    "She treated almost everyone on the same level, not below or above her, but as equals."
    "Somewhat admirable but also undesirable."
    "I'd met her before just because she's a friend of Maeko but we haven't talked much before this."
    k"So, I assume you're here to see Maeko?"
    a"Yeah we are, we wanted to check the clubroom to see if she's here."
    k"Well I haven't seen her all morning so let's take a look."
    "Natsumi goes ahead and slides the door open, but as she does it she whispers in my ear."
    k"So what's she doing here? Is she your girlfriend?"
    "I can feel my face going bright red and hope it's not obvious to Setsuko."
    "I shake my head violently in disagreement without muttering a word hoping Setsuko didn't hear or suspect anything."
    k"Haha ha, I can see that's somewhat of a controversial topic."
    "I wanted to shut her mouth somehow but it looks like with those final words she's done teasing for now."
    "I'd been here before and from the looks of things not much had changed since I'd been here last."
    "Most of the room is just piles of old no longer in use books on shelves with the exception of the few changes the literature club had made to suit their needs as a club."
    "There was a table looking out onto the school field through a window along with a bookshelf specifically for literature club books."
    
    "It felt strange to me but I'm sure it would've had a homely feel to it if you were a club member."
    "Speaking of which, Maeko was silently reading a book on the table by the window, staring intently as if she never noticed our arrival."
    
    k"Hey Maeko, you're friends are here."
    "Natsumi put her hand in front of Maeko's face while moving it side to side to grab her attention away from the book."
    k"*Sigh* She always does this if she gets really into a story."
    "Maeko's gaze does lift from the pages however."
    b"Natsumi! What are you doing I was just up to the... Huh?"
    b"Oh, Takeru's here, and Setsuko too."
    b"I'm so sorry, I didn't notice you guys at all! Let me make you all some tea..."
    a"Wait Maeko, wait!"
    a"We've got no time for tea right now, school is about ot start and we've got some good news for you."
    "Maeko turns back toward me noting my sense of urgency and excitement."
    a"My parents wouldn't allow you to stay over."
    a"They felt we wouldn't be able to handle an extra person especially in your case. A few nights would've been ok but a long period of stay would be too much."
    "Maeko's face dropped in disappointment."
    a"However, I also got Setsuko to ask her parents."
    a"And they said yes!"
    "Maeko's face lit right back up to this news, she could finally escape her awful homelife and feel accepted again, hopefully."
    b"Surely I won't be staying for free though right?"
    c"My parents have calculated a very low rent fee to cover your costs so as long as you can pay that they were fine."
    b"Thank you so much Setsuko!"
    b"Thank you too Takeru!"
    "Maeko pulled us in together for a group hug, this isn't too normal for her but this moment has obviously lifted a huge burden off of her shoulders."
    
    "While accepting Maeko's warm embrace and appreciation I notice out of the corner of my eye Natsumi is standing awkwardly to the side, looking at us but avoiding anyone's gaze."
    k"Well I hate to break this all up but I'm afraid class is about to start everyone."
    k"You better all head off now."
    
    "You can easily tell that Maeko's eyes are wet with tears that she was attempting to hold back."
    "After hearing Natsumi's warning I loosen my embrace and step back a little."
    "Everyone else also releases their grip."
    
    a"Yeah, Natsumi is right we better get going."
    b"Bye Natsumi!"
    k"Oh Maeko will you be coming here after school today?"
    b"No sorry, I've got to handle some things at home today."
    k"Ok then, see you tomorrow!"

    #--> Maeko 1st Lunch with Take and Setsu
    ############################################
    
    "Maeko seemed to be much happier this morning during class after the news we gave her. Although she still seemed anxious about something."
    "It's lunch now."
    "Most of the class is moving out to eat their lunch and Setsuko and I are one of those two."
    "Maeko also got up when we did."
    b"Hey Takeru, Setsuko, do you mind if I sit and eat lunch with you guys today? I need to ask you a few more things about me leaving my uncle and aunt's place."
    
    "Setsuko looks to me as soon she heard Maeko's request."

    a "Yeah of course you can Maeko."
    
    "We walked up that stairwell, this time as three to discuss our plans of Maeko's new home."
    "We all sit with our backs to the iron fence in the open sunlight."
    b"Do you two sit here every lunch?"
    "I spluttered while eating my lunch after hearing this question."
    "Setsuko remained quiet abstaining from answering the question."
    "It's up to me."
    a"Oh um, not EVERY lunch but yeah we sit here quite a bit."
    b"Hmm, I see."
    b"Haha, oh what am I asking anyway?"
    b"I came here to ask Setsuko about what living at her place is like and what I need to do to keep her parents happy with their decision."
    c"You want to know about that?"
    b"Yes, I think it's important if I'm to stay there for the next year and a half. I'll probably leave after high school. I really don't want to be a burden to your family."
    c"Don't worry too much about things Maeko, my parents are pretty relaxed about things, which is probably the reason they accepted your request in the first place."
    c"As long as you can pay that small rent and don't abuse their generousity they'll be fine with keeping you."
    b"Of course not, I'd never do anything to make them angry."
    c"Well it's fine then. You'll be ok."
    "Maeko's obviously just anxious about living in a stranger's house that is her last option."

    c"The only problem is how do you expect to just leave your current home?"
    c"Will your uncle let you? And can you handle carrying all of your belongings on foot here?"
    b"There's no need to worry about that."
    b"Honestly I think he'll be glad to have me gone and I have barely anything to take here."
    "Maeko's painfully correct about that. I recall her printing all of her assignments at the library's printer because she could never do it at home. And she would have to first type it up on one of the school computers from pages she had written at home."
    "I'm surprised she managed to keep such good grades and uphold such high standards or herself with those conditions."
    "Despite it being convienent for this situation it's saddening that she probably wouldn't have anything more than what would fill her schoolbag."
    "And it's not because her aunt and uncle were poor either."
    "I never really realised her situation until just recently."
    "But I'm glad I know it now."
    "Because I can help."
    c"Oh, I guess that's good then..."
    b"I'll just pack my things up when I get home and tell my aunt about what's happening."
    b"She's slightly more understanding than my uncle would be."
    b"She'll be able to fill him in with the details after I leave, I'd rather not have to tell him myself."
    b"I'll probably arrive at your building later tonight, but I'll need your unit number to get in."
    a"Oh don't worry about that, I'll just give you my card to get in. I'll be walking back with Setsuko anyway so we can both get in with just her card."
    a"Hold on, I'll just get it out of my bag."
    a"Here you go."
    b"Thanks Takeru! I'll give it back when I get there."

    "We talked for a little while longer but our lunchtime was soon over."

    "The school day was soon over and just as Setsuko and I were about to leave for home I got a message on my phone."
    "It couldn't be Maeko because I just said goodbye to her a minute ago."
    "It was from my mother."
    m"Hey Takeru would you mind picking some things up for me from the grocery store for dinner while you're out?"
    "Just below that line was a list of ingredients as well as a few other things that we needed for dinner and the following week."
    "I guess mum must be too busy with work to get them."
    "Hold on, how does she expect me to have the money for all of this?!"
    "There's too much to buy, I don't have that kind of money on me!"
    "I swipe further down the message."
    "You'll find the money for the groceries in the front pocket of your bag."
    "Huh?"
    "I quickly swing the bag off my back to check the front pocket."
    "And sure enough $100 was right there."
    c"You alright Takeru?"
    "I just noticed, I had taken my phone out of my pocket and had been staring at it for a minute now without saying a word to Setsuko."
    a"Oh sorry, it's just my mum sent me a text and is asking me to do some grocery shopping before going home."
    a"I'm going to go do it now."
    a"You can head back home while I go do it."
    c"No, it's alright, I want to come help, it'll be hard carrying all of the groceries yourself."
    "Setsuko's makes a good point, and I'm not apposed to her coming along anyway."

    c"It let out far too much water and hit the major farming region for potatoes in the country."
    c"A few other crops were harmed too but potatoes were hit hardest."
    c"Honestly it's probably better to go without them when they're this expensive."
    a"You're right we don't need them."
    c"But you're mum put it on the list right? She's obviously aware of their current price too and she must need them for something."
    c"Really I don't know how you weren't aware of the flooding but I know almost everyone knows about it."
    c"I'm sure she'd know about it."
    a"Sure, I suppose we should, I won't get too many though."
    "After that I pull out my phone to check the rest of the list."
    "Carrots are done, onions are done, pot... aren't on the list."

    "No, I'm absolutely certain."

    "Where."
    "Where did it go?!"
    "It can't just disappear like that!"
    "What's going on?!"
    "I've had my middle finger for my entire life, it can't disappear like this."
    "With no warning."
    "No memory of loss."
    "Nothing."
    "Just like the space between my index and ring finger."
    "I stumbled back from the mirror and washing basin."
    "Holding my hand up and staring at my face through the new gap."
    "'Is this me?' I thought."
    "I can't even remember what happened, I'd know if I were missing a finger right?"
    "So this happened just recently."
    "But how?"
    "With that thought the pattern on my hand illuminates."
    "The pattern that was tattooed onto my hand during the night Setsuko died flashed for just a second."
    "It has to have something to do with time travel doesn't it?"
    "It's the only thing I know of that could explain something like this."
    "Although I didn't think time travel was possibly until this past week so it could be something entirely different that I'm still yet to be aware of."
    
    "Then a thought hits me, one that could prove to be grim."
    "My hands are where my power concentrates whenever I travel through time."
    "If my middle finger is no longer there..."
    "It may mean my powers won't work, or will be even more unstable then before."
    "This means I will have to not use my powers again for at least a while."
    "Until I can figure out what's going on."
    
    "But what would Setsuko think if I just came out with my middle finger missing?!"
    "In her eyes I went to the bathroom with my hands intact."
    "And will come out with one missing."
    "There's no reasonable way for me to hide my hand."
    "It would look incredibly suspicious if I held my hands in my pocket or wrapped it in my shirt."
    "I'll just have to hope she's doesn't notice."
    "I opened the door with a click and Setsuko turned to face me from the kitchen."
    c"The tea's ready!"
    a"Ahh good."
    "I walked over to the coffee table in the lounge and sat beside it, waiting for Setsuko to bring the tea over."
    "Setsuko walked over to me with a tray, holding a few biscuits and two cups of tea."
    "But as she walked I noticed her arms begin to sway."
    "Then beginning to falter."
    "She couldn't hold it much longer."
    "I quickly got up and tried to reach her in time before everything spilled."
    "But I was too late."
    "Everything fell onto the floor, I stepped back as it was falling to avoid any broken china pieces from piercing my skin."
    "A tea stain was already spreading through the carpet while the crumbs of the biscuit laid softly."
    "The china made a shattering noise at our feet."
    "I looked up at Setsuko."
    "She stood there speechless for a while."
    "Until our eyes met she stared past me."
    "She focused back into reality."
    c"I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry about all of this."
    c"Urghh I messed up again!"
    c"All of this going to waste!"
    a"It's ok Setsuko, really I don't mind. I'll help clean this up."
    c"No it's my fault I need to fix it."
    a"You may have caused this but you can't stop me from trying to help you."
    "This time Setsuko was the one to let out a sigh."
    c"Alright."
    "We began picking up the pieces of china after soaking up the tea stain with a wet cloth."
    "But all the while I'm sure Setsuko should've noticed by now, that my middle finger was no longer present."
    "There's no way she could've missed it unless something is up."
    "My mind flashes back briefly to the scene of that man's disappearance after I shot the bullet."
    "Setsuko had no idea what was going on, like nothing had happened, maybe the same thing is happening right now."
    
    with dissolve
    "We'd just finished cleaning up when a knock came from the front door."
    "I let Setsuko greet whoever it is, I'm not in a position to answer the door of someone elses home."
    "But as the door opened I heard a familiar friendly voice."
    "It was Maeko, she was here with a large jacket, her school bag and a bag she was carrying in her hand."
    "I quickly glanced outside to the window, it was dark." 
    "Then I searched for a clock in the room, it was easy to find."
    "I hadn't noticed before but it was already 7:30pm"
    "Which meant that Maeko was walking alone in the cold night carrying these bags."
    "I feel my insides disagree with just the thought of that situation."
    "And they also feel like I should've been there with her."
    c"Takeru, Maeko's here!"
    a"Cool, Hey Maeko!"
    b"Hey Takeru."
    b"So what are you doing over here? I thought I was supposed to meet you at your place?"
    a"Sorry about that, I actually realised just earlier, I gave you my keycard so I couldn't get into my place."
    b"Oh, sorry about that!"
    a"No it was my bad don't worry about it."
    "I took a step forward and picked up Maeko's bag."
    a"Where will Maeko be sleeping?"
    c"Just down this way."
    "Even after taking her bag off her using the hand without a finger Maeko doesn't notice its absence at all."
    "Nobody does."
    b"Here's your card."
    a"Thanks."
    a"I think I might head back to my place now. You'll need some time to get settled in."
    b"Alright, see you tomorrow morning!"
    c"Goodnight Takeru!"
    "I turned the doorknob and shut the door behind me."
    "Everything has an unfamiliar feel to it when I only have four fingers on one hand."
    "Nothing feels right."
    "But there's no point dwelling on it now."
    "I have to keep going if I'm going to find out what's happening to me."
    "I turn and head toward my apartments door, I wrap my fingers around the door knob feeling the absence of the familiar cold feeling usually present in the space between my fingers."
    "Just as I turn the doorknob I hear footstep coming up the stairs."
    "I spin around and poke my head out above the railing to check whoever is coming up."
    "It's just my sister, Saya."
    "Geez, what is she doing coming home so late?"
    "A girl like her shouldn't be out alone at this time of night."
    "Maeko was bad enough but she didn't have much of a choice and she's at least 2 years older."
    "I wait for her to climb the stairs and try to act how a dissappointed brother should."
    d"Oh, I didn't see you there Takeru."
    a"You know you shouldn't be out alone at night, it's not saf..."
    "It was at that moment I saw her face."
    "Her hair was covering it as she was walking up the stairs."
    "She looked absolutely miserable."
    "Her eyes were red and her cheeks were puffy, evidently from crying."
    "This obviously wasn't the time for me to be lecturing her."
    a"Ah, never mind! Let's head inside."
    "Silently she waited by the door for me to swipe the keycard."
    "She turned the handle the moment the 'ding' went off from the lock."
    "Saya was looking at the floor as she walked in."
    "She really doesn't look ok."
    a"Wait, Sa..."
    "Before I could finish my sentence she had already made it into her room, with her door shut."
    "I guess she doesn't want to talk about it."
    "Oh well, there's not much I can do if she's going to act like that."
    "I wish I could help though."
    "I drop my bag down in my room and prepare for bed."
    "Laying down in my bed I close my eyes, forgetting about the lost finger and everything else."

    "I woke up with cold sweat trailing down my back."
    "I'd heard something."
    "My heart begins to thump, louder and louder, faster and faster."
    "All the while I'm sure it's probably just my parents coming home from work, or maybe Saya just getting a drink."
    "I need to calm down."
    "Why am I so scared all of a sudden?"
    "I rest my head back down onto the pillow in a comfortable position."
    "But I hear footsteps."
    "But my heart is beating much louder than the steps moving outside my room."
    "They are quiet, like they're trying not to wake anyone up."
    "I feel like a child without a nightlight."
    "I need to get to sleep, this shouldn't bother me as much as it does."
    "Once again, I close my eyes."
    "A few minutes pass without any noise, I can feel myself on the brink of falling asleep."
    "But then my door creaks open."
    "Someone has definitely entered my room."
    "I open my eyes expecting it to be my parents checking on me."
    "It'd be an unusual time to check but it's not too much of an outlandish idea."
    "But instead I saw Saya standing in the door way."
    "With her hand behind her back."
    "It was quite dark but I could see enough."
    "Her face is streaming with tears."
    "But her expression is blank, and she isn't making any noise."
    "I look at her and our gaze connects, but she immediately looks away."
    "Suddenly Saya makes a rush toward me in my bed, aggressively."
    "I scrambled up from my bed, trying to kick off the sheets."
    "But my sister is by my side within half a second."
    "I wasn't mistaken, I could just tell. My sister wasn't joking around here."
    "She wanted to harm me in at least some way."
    "There's no time to think 'Why?', I just have to deal with what's in front of me."
    "Saya revealed the object behind her back, it was a glove, with an inscription that was very similar to the inscription on my hands."
    "It was glowing with bright blue sparks, flashes of light flew across the room in every direction."
    "She reaches out toward me with the glove."
    "I can feel the heat radiating from the glove."
    "I need something to stop her from melting my face off my neck."
    "I grab my sheet and toss it on top of Saya while rolling off the other side of the bed."
    "Well, at least I would have if the sheet didn't vaporise instantly on contact with the glove."
    "And as quick as it disappeared I could feel Saya's grip around my arm."
    "But it wasn't hot, my skin wasn't burnt."
    "I just felt an overwhelming sense of nausea."
    "Then my head fell back onto my pillow."
    "All while hearing a faint, soft voice."
    d"Sorry, Takeru."

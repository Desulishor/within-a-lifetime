    c"Sorry about this."
    "She tries to speak, this time with a voice much softer than before."
    c"It only happens every once and while."
    c"I have a condition that sometimes makes me unexplainably feel nauseous for a few moments, usually I end up fainting and falling to the floor."
    c"So thanks for catching me."
    a"Don't worry about it, you were falling toward me anyway so it's not like I could just step out of your way."

    c"It's just, I'm new and I don't really know anyone yet so I feel like I'd be making a mistake if I randomly joined a club and didn't fit in properly."

    c"Are we friends?"

    "How can someone cope like that for their entire life?"
    "Does that mean that even now, I'm the closest thing she's had to a friend?"
    "Probably{p} not."
    "There's no way, and we've only known eachother for half a day."
    "I'm sure she would've been at some of her other schools for long enough to make a least something close to a friend."

    "I slowly raise from the ground, and see Kunikada right in front of me."
    "She's still trying to struggle, trying to scream."
    "But the cloaked figured has completely silenced her, and is holding her in place."
    "While Kunikada's tear filled eyes stare directly into my own."
    b"Please, help me!"
    "I can't her hear voice."
    "But I can hear her plea."
    "I stare at the empty spot within the dark hood."
    "It's completely black, even in the middle of the day I can't identify anything on where his face should be."
    a"Hey asshole."
    "I try to get the black figure's attention."
    "Anything to keep him distracted for just a moment."
    "For Kunikada to break free."
    "He turns his head slightly toward me, acknowledging my existence, nothing more."
    "I charge at him, in some desperate attempt at a surpise attack."
    "The cloak is ready for me, he swiftly moves to the side and throws me back onto the ground, this time harder than last."
    "My body crashes onto the floor and then rolls like a ragdoll."
    "My entire back hurts even more than before."
    "I can't feel any blood, but then again I can't feel much of anything."
    "But there's no way I can give up."
    "I stand yet again, giving it my all."
    "I'm sure if he wanted to he could've killed both me and Kunikada by now."
    "But for whatever reason, he wasn't."
    "Like he was just playing with us."
    "Like toys."
    "Filled with rage this time I throw a punch straight for his head."
    "He dodges it easily while pushing me to the side."
    "I can feel a sharp pain in my upper right rib cage."
    "I can taste blood at the back of my throat."
    "I try again, this time I charge at him in the back, attempting to knock him off balance."
    "But I practically bounce straight back off."
    "The dark body doesn't move an inch."
    "This person... {p} this thing... {p} whatever it is... {p} It's not human."
    "I try to keep up with my breath, and my heart beat, I'm starting to feel faint."
    "But from the looks of things Kunikada is suffocating in his arms."
    "I don't know what to do anymore."
    "What is there left to do?"
    "This 'thing' is on an entirely different level."
    "But there has to be something, anything!"
    "The figure raises Kunikada up in his grasp with one hand and with the other he also raises his long, blue metallic blade."
    "The sharp blade edges closer and closer to her neck."
    "How am I so useless?!"
    "Can somebody help?"
    "I search my surroundings, but no one is there."
    "It's too unnatural, there isn't a chance that nobody would've noticed this by now."
    "We're right next to the main road and yet there aren't even any cars."
    "I'm alone, I'm the only one."
    "I clench my first."
    "It's not up to anyone else now, she's relying on me."
    "I face the shadow in front of me, but I don't step any closer."
    "It looks as if he's holding her as hostage."
    "He would've killed her otherwise."
    "But his hand is shaking, quite violently too."
    "Like he can't control it."
    "Some of his limbs begin to shake but others freeze up entirely."
    "This is my chance!"
    "I charge straight at the cloaked figure with full force managing to knock him just enough for his grip to release on Kunikada."
    "Kunikada falls to the ground beneath him."
    a"Come on Kunikada! We have to run now!"
    "I was just stating the obvious, Kunikada had already sustained similar injuries to what I had but we had to get away from here as fast as we could."
    "Judging from what this thing can do, our only chance is to hide."
    "A police station isn't going to do anything, even if there was one nearby."
    "Kunikada looks up at me with teary eyes, she nods as if she's understood."
    "I grab Kunikada's hand and rush down the nearest street, just running as far and as fast as I could."
    "After multiple turns down several different streets we come to a place I'm very familiar with."
    "Maeko and I used to play here as kids, it's a forest up in the mountains."
    "If we go up here we might just be safe."
    "We stop when we're deep enough in. Night has already fallen and the stars are shining through the gap in the canopy above"
    c"What was that thing?"
    a"I don't know, but I'd rather not risk finding out."
    c"Me neither."
    a"Are you alright?"
    c"I can't say I am."
    a"Yeah, I didn't think so."
    "We'd dropped our school bags a long way back so we're just two high schoolers lying down, staring up at the starry night."
    "We've got nothing but the clothes on our backs"
    "No food, no water, it's cold and we're running from something that's worse than all three of those combined."
    "Neither of us will complain though, we can't afford to bring down our morale any more."
    "We'd give up if we did"
    c"What a first day..."
    c"First I get lost, then I faint, for the first time I don't break my face, then you get dragged into a scene from a horror film."
    a"You didn't know that guy did you?"
    c"I've got no clue who or what that thing was."
    a"So you really did just fall into this mess?"
    c"Honestly I was going ask you if you had any idea what all this is about."
    c"But as awful as this has been."
    c"I've never had this much fun before."
    a"Don't worry, I've got a place in mind that we can stay the night, it should be completely safe."
    a"Soon we'll be out of the cold, we'll be hidden, and we'll be ok."
    a"Hopefully if we just stay there for the night, we won't be bothered by that guy tommorow."
    c"Alright."
    "Kunikada stands up to follow me, she sounds weak and frail."
    a"Here, just lean on me, we can make it."
    "Kunikada doesn't object but the edge of my rib cage flairs up in pain."
    a"Owwww!"
    c"Sorry, sorry!"
    a"No, no, it's ok."
    "We make a weak almost crawl further into the forest, the old log cabin is in sight."
    "Nobody has used it in years, someone used to live in it decades ago but it's been in disprepair ever since."
    "Maeko and I used to play there when we were younger."

#    "Crap, he knows! Did Kunikada tell him!"
#    a"Sorry, I couldn't take her home this afternoon, something came up."
#    f"I thought that might have been the case, she's no longer with us Ichiro."
#    a"Wait what? What do you mean isn't with us?!"

    "I have no trouble getting back to the dormitory from school."
    "I remember the route from this morning when I walked with Kenta."
    "Now that I'm at the dormitory I don't have much to do until school tomorrow."
    "I lie down on the bed, feeling both mentally and physically exhausted from the day."
    "I'm still not too comfortable with this change, my daily routine has changed so fast."
    "I have no idea what my future here might bring me, its uncertain and unpredictable."
    "All of my stuff is already packed, from the great generosity of Kenta."
    "And its not like I really have any friends to hang out with after school."
    "I really do have to decide on a club soon."
    "Mana talked about the swimming club, and the literature club."
    "I'm not so sure how I feel about either of those just yet. I guess I like to read."
    "Natsumi talked about the baseball club, but I can't join that."
    "And that leaves me with... nothing."
    "In the end the clubs I heard about today were just a drop in the puddle of school activities."
    "I'm sure I'll figure something out, something will come up."
    "I try to forget everything else as I eventually wait for night to fall."
    "The long shadows of the sunset eventually disappear meaning night has finally begun."
    "I do grab a book out to pass the time, but I don't get much reading done."
    "Every line just feels like a mass of incomprehensible words as my mind wonders off away from the page."
    "Eventually, and perhaps luckily my tiredness gets the better of me as I drift away."

    "My vision is blurred with brightness that has just increased in my bedroom."
    "It hurts to hold them open for too long, my eyes are yet to adjust."
    d"Takeru! Get up already, it's late!"
    "The sharp requests of my little sister vibrate throughout my head, putting me into a daze."
    "My senses are pretty weak right now."
    d"Takeru!"
    a"Eyughhh..."
    "Too much effort to say any real words, and even if I tried I doubt I could make a sentence."
    "I was expecting to hear Saya complain further, instead she left my room."
    "I spent a while in my guilty pleasure of resting, even though I probably should've started to get ready for school by now."
    "..."
    "My eyelids drifted closer to being shut."
    "Just as I was getting comfortable something large and heavy put itself upon my torso."
    "Before I could open my eyes to see what it was a wet towel covered my face."
    d"Ahahahaahaha!"
    d"Ahaahahahaha!"
    "It was my sister, and she wouldn't stop laughing."
    "Despite how I was before she did succeed in waking me up completely, I grabbed the towel and threw it in the direction of body laying on top of me."
    "I had been humiliated, but it's not like it mattered at all to me."
    a"Come on sis, you need to head off for school too!"
    d"Huh? What are you talking about?"
    "I turn to the side, checking my bedside clock."
    "It was Saturday, I had completely forgotten it was the end of the week."
    "The time repeats messed with my sense of what day it was."
    "And even worse was the fact it was 6:45am, she woke me up this early for no reason but for her own amusement."
    a"What?! Why did you have to wake me up so early on a weekend!?"
    d"Ahaahhaahhahha!"
    "It was the same laugh as before."
    a"Stop laughing!"
    d"Takeru, are you being serious right now?"
    a"Of course I'm serious, I'm pretty mad too!"
    d"Ahaahhaahhahha!"
    d"It's Tuesday today! I didn't think you were that stupid to forget that sort of thing, even if I did change your clock."
    "Just when I thought the previous humiliation was over the second round had already begun, I underestimated my little sister."
    d"So come on then, you better get ready for school!"
    "Her tone was too cheerful for my view of this morning and I despised her because of it."
    "She left my room after that, finally."

    "Soon after that I left the house, stepping into the cold air once again."
    "However today was a new day."
    "I glanced at the mailbox as I walked by incase I'd gotten another letter."
    "Somewhat dissappointadly, I had not."
    "On the way to school I had this strange habit in my head to be on the lookout for Maeko, not because I wanted to apologise but because I thought she'd come this way today."
    "Actually with that thought, I wonder if Kunikada already left before me? Maybe I should've walked with her today."
    "Although I admit I'd be a little scared to ask her, seems a little awkward."
    
    "In anycase, today I was alone on my walk to school."
    "Without much motivation I slowly made my way there, while paying attention to the time on my watch."
    "I've seen a few people from my school that I know while walking but I dont attempt making any conversation with them."
    "I don't usually talk to many people outside of the ones I'm friends with already."
    "The bell rang just as I entered the school gates so I made my way up the stairs to my classroom."
    "I entered class and glanced at Maeko, my heart sunk a little as I saw her obviously looking down."
    "I have a duty to fix this, but it'll have to wait until later."
    "Then I took my seat next to Kunikada, I glanced at her too, however she was already looking at me."
    "Our eyes connected but she immediately shifted her gaze elsewhere."
    "I sat down, waiting for our homeroom teacher to arrive."
    "I sat through class without paying much attention, I was actually fairly tired still since the time travel messed with my sleep cycle."
    "That said I was aware that no important announcement had been made."
    "Classes trailed on until lunchtime, I didn't get a chance to speak to Maeko at lunch because some of my guy friends were talking to me and I didn't get the chance to slip away."
    "However during that time I did notice Kunikada was sitting alone at her desk, she seemed to be finding it tough making friends at a new school."
    "Maybe I should go talk to her at lunch...?"
    "But Maeko's looking down too, I need to talk to her."
    "Who should I talk to at lunch?"

    "Maeko pushed her seat out behind her to get up the moment the bell sounded."
    "Damn it! She can't leave yet!"
    "I'd miss my opportunity so I move over to stop her from leaving."
    a"Hey Maeko."
    "I noticed her body had stiffened for a moment before turning her head to reply."

    "I was relieved to see her smile, although I'm well aware it's probably a fake."

    "Multiple seconds had passed before I noticed I had become so distracted by her smile."
    a"I uh..."
    "This time I was the one who was embarrassed."
    a"I wanted to talk to you about something, can you come to the roof with me so we can talk alone?"
    b"Yeah, if you want. Let me just grab things."
    "She packed her books and grabbed her bag."
    "We made our way up the staircase to the rooftop."
    "On a day like today almost everywhere is cold outside."
    "However the roof has the benefit of unobstructed sun."
    "Apart from the entrance building, however that also serves to block the wind."
    "Although today that building didn't serve any purpose, there was no wind for it to block."

    b"Oh... so that's what happened."

    b"That's a relief."

    b"Yeah."
    a"Alright then."
    a"Did you want to have lunch here since we've already come all this way?"
    "She stood there without saying a word."
    a"It's just it's been a while since we've talked together like this, or even had lunch together."
    b"I'm really sorry Takeru but I need to go to a student council meeting today, I should already be there right now but you sounded like you had something important to say."
    a"Oh. Ok then, see you later."

    "After I took my seat Maeko arrived from the student council meeting."
    "She seemed fine, certainly a lot better than before lunch."
    "I guess I cheered her up by clearing things up."

    "I suppose I could just use the same plan but it would still be risky."
    "In any case, there doesn't seem to be a limit on what I could use the power for."
    "For example, I could find out today's lottery numbers and go back and buy a ticket with those same numbers."
    "Sounds a little boring though, and it's not like I need the money. It is an option though if I want to rich."

    "Yes, of course I do. Even if things go wrong it'll still be a better existence than most of the people in this world."
    "Ok, I'll test it right after I get up tomorrow morning, if things do take me back to that day's morning I should just end up in bed a few minutes before."

    "I took a second or two to put my thoughts together until I remembered why I had come here in the first place."
    a"You know how you said you'd sit with me at lunch sometime?"
    c"I said 'might' want to sit with you."
    a"Huh? So you don't anymore?"
    c"It's not that..."
    a"That's good then, why don't you come with me up to the roof for lunch?"

    "I brought out my lunch, nothing special. I only ever bring things straight from the pantry without much preparation, I'm too lazy to prepare anything good."
    "My Mum and Dad work early too so they're too busy to make me anything."
    "Kunikada pulls out her own lunchbox."
    "As she opens the box my interest in the contents increases."
    "She has a full boxed meal in there, completely prepared!"
    a"Wow, I can't believe you have something like that just for lunch!"
    c"Oh this?"
    "She sounded confused at my astonishment."
    a"Well it's just all I have is this, and you have such a good lunch."
    c"Oh... I just made this together this morning, a bit from dinner last night and some other things."
    c"Do you want to try some?"
    a"If you don't mind..."
    c"Of course, here try."

    "Until I noticed how awkward was, she seemed to have figured it out at the same time I did."
    "She was mouth feeding me with her own chopsticks."
    c"Oh uhm... how about I just put this in your hand ok?"
    a"Yeah! Of... of course!"

    "I wanted to express how much I liked it to her right now but my mouth was still full."
    a"Wow this is really good!"
    c"I'm glad you like it. While I made it myself I can't take all of the credit, my mother is a really good cook and helps me out a lot."
    a"Is that her profession?"
    c"No she doesn't work, she stay's at home."
    c"My dad is the only one who works in my family, but it's ok since I'm an only child."
    c"With the travelling he's done my mum can't really hold down a job in one location for any extended period of time so she just gave up in the end."
    a"But you should be staying here now right, for a long while to come?"
    c"Yeah that's the plan so maybe she'll find a job soon."
    c"It's not entirely necessary though, financially speaking that is." 
    a"Now that you say that I'm kinda jealous, it'd be cool to have at least one parent around most of the time."
    c"It's not as cool as you think, it can be pretty restrictive."
    a"Actually, I didn't think about that."

    "Class passes by slowly and I almost fall asleep multiple times."
    "For some reason Hikari's map never leaves my hand."
    "I find myself reading it over constantly."
    "I could swear that Hikari drew the directions from her room to the student council room."
    "Yet the map in front of me is telling me how to get there from my classroom."
    "Since maps don't change on their own, I have to assume that Hikari had the foresight to put in this little detail."
    "I really have to thank her properly next time I see her."

    "Slowly the minute hand inches towards the mark and then-"
    "The bell rings and I'm out the door immediately after we say our farewells to the teacher."
    "With Hikari's map I'm at the student council room within five minutes."
    "Upon walking through the door the first thing I spot is a table packed with stacks of papers on top, and right next to it..."
    "Meiko is glaring at me, looking straight at the stack of papers in my hands."
    b"What the hell Takeru! I said immediately, not two hours later!"
    a"So-sorry, I didn't know how to get here and I had to ask for di-"
    b"Whatever, it's good that you're here, put that stack here, quickly!"
    "Shaking my head I drop it all on the only empty part of the desk."
    b"Phew, finally done for today."
    "She kneels down and closes her eyes, yawning."
    a"Uh, Meiko?"
    b"Huh? I'm awake, I'm awake."
    "She bolts upright and stands to attention, even though she's still bleary eyed."
    a"Uh..."
    a"Hi."
    "She blinks a couple of times, as if she doesn't recognise me."
    "Then she suddenly gasps."
    "At that moment I notice too, I haven't seen or even spoken to Meiko for years now."
    b"Takeru..."
    a"Yeah, it's been a while, Meiko."
    ab"Where did you go"
    "Both of us ask the same question, in turn Meiko's cheeks flush a little and there's no doubt mine are doing the same."
    "We both awkwardly laugh to ease the tension."
    "A few seconds pass and Meiko just darts her eyes to the side of me."
    "I don't think either of us want to answer that question."
    "It's like we've already made a silent agreement not to."
    b"So why are you back?"
    "The one question I didn't want to hear."
    "Why am I back here?"
    a"I ran into some issues... at my old school."
    "She deserves to know that much, but I can't bring myself to tell her anymore."
    b"Mhmm."
    "She accepts my answer without prying, and for that I'm thankful."
    "I guess that after all this time Meiko hasn't changed at all."
    a"So have you been doing much since I last saw you?"
    b"Well as you can probably tell, I'm part of the student council."
    b"Apart from that, I haven't done anything interesting."
    "I accept her answer for now, I know it's hard to recall every major event in your life for the past five years."
    "Mostly because I just tried to."
    b"Anyway, do you have something you want to ask about? I can show you around the school if you'd like, give you a bit of a tour?"
    a"Sure, actually that would be pretty helpful, the amount of times I've gotten lost these past two days would probably surprise you."
    b"Well then, it's my duty as a student council member to help you out."
    "Meiko reaffirms her position and puffs her chest out a little, it looks like she's proud of her position."
    "That makes me curious about where the other members are."
    "The room is empty apart from us two."
    a"Where is everyone else?"
    "Meiko looks around the room, though I'm sure she already knows we're the only ones here."
    b"They're probably all just slacking off, well not really though. The closest thing we have to prepare for right now is the school festival, and even that's in a while."
    b"So let's go, I've already finished up here for today."
    b"You don't have anything else this afternoon right?"
    a"Nope, not really."
    b"Great, then let the tour begin."
    "Meiko stands from her desk and walks straight out of the door, expecting me to follow."
    "Being with her has a familiar nostalgic feel to it."

    "The "tour" that Meiko conducts literally consists of her pointing and naming faraway objects."
    "We soon pass the old building, the place where Hikari often sits."
    "I wonder if she's still there right now."
    "Unconsciously, I begin to stare at it while slowing my pace."
    a"Hey, what about that place?"
    b"Oh right, I should definitely tell you about that one."
    b"That's the oldest building in the school."
    b"Most of the other ones have had at least their insides renovated since the fire last year."
    a"Woah there was a fire last year?"
    b"Oh, you didn't know?"
    "I can't believe I've never heard about it either."
    a"Yeah, I had no idea."

    b"Most of the school was here that day, including me."
    b"It started pretty abruptly."
    b"We didn't notice anything until it was too late."
    b"In a lot of places the fire was truly blazing out of control."
    b"The landscape you see around you today would be a different one than if you were to come here a year ago."
    b"Some buildings had to be demolished entirely as they were reduced to just a few columns and pillars of ash."
    b"It happened on the day of the school festival."
    b"It's been hard for us, a lot of stalls will need to be checked several times a day for safety hazards in case another fire breaks out."
    b"We've all been working hard on it because no one wants a repeat of last year."
    b"We can't afford another disaster like that."
    "Meiko's expression turns grim as the last sentence exits her lips."
    a"Did they ever find out what caused the fire?"
    b"I'm not sure, but I heard the investigators couldn't find any definitive evidence, so it's assumed that one of the cooking stalls caused it."
    b"The most likely scenario was that someone left their station while food was cooking, until it eventually burnt and caught fire."
    b"That's just an assumption though."
    "Meiko's cheerfulness has completely dissipated."
    "We'd actually stopped moving when she started to speak about the festival."
    "I'm still focussed on the older building that managed to survive."
    "Actually, Hikari had those burn scars didn't she."
    "She couldn't have gotten them from that fire..."
    "Could she?"
    "Meiko did say most of the students here would remember the fire, meaning they would've also witnessed it."
    "I'd ask Hikari about it, but I don't really want to bring that subject up with her."
    a"Do you know of a girl named Hikari?"
    b"...?"
    b"So you do know about that day?"
    b"Everyone evacuated the school safely without harm."
    b"Everyone except for the only sole casualty Hikari."
    b"We held a funeral at the school, everyone attended it, even though it wasn't mandatory."
    b"I suppose you must've heard about it from someone..."
    "Did she just say... Hikari?"
    "There's no way... that's impossible isn't it?"
    "I just spoke to Hikari before coming here."
    "She must just be talking about a different Hikari right?"
    b"Takeru, are you feeling alr---"
    "Meiko gives me a light tap on the back."
    "Her mouth is still moving but I can no longer understand the words that are coming out."
    "I try to convince myself that Meiko is talking about someone else."
    "But somewhere in my soul I know it's true."
    "The girl I was talking to a few hours ago is no longer alive?"
    "And she hasn't been for almost a year now?"
    "But I can't just accept this."
    "I'm witnessing two different realities."
    "So which one can I call real?"
    "Meiko starts to shake me as she's still saying something."
    a"Huh?"
    b"Takeru, you look like you've seen a ghost, are you feeling ok?"
    "A ghost..."
    "Is that it?"

    "I had a brief flash of darkness again."
    "But no sooner had I awoke in my bedroom."
    "What just happened?"
    "Was that all just a dream?"
    "No, not a chance. It was too real to be a dream."
    "And yet I couldn't believe any of it."
    "I check the time and date, it was 7am, Wednesday the 5th of March."
    "In other words, it was the day I had missed before, where I apparently agreed to call Setsuko by her first name."
    "Two days after saving Setsuko."
    "And the day before I lost my finger."
    "Hold on..."
    "I look down at my hands."
    "My finger is back!"
    "It's truly back in the place just as it was before, appearing just as it had left."
    "Who knows what might happen tomorrow though, it may dissappear in the exact same way."
    "School is on today and I have no reason not to go."
    "Despite what happened, I won't discover anything by staying in this room."
    "So I step outside."
    "Right in front of me, is Saya."
    d"Good morning Takeru!"
    "I'm in complete shock."
    "I had completely forgotten about Saya and her glove that night."
    "But for some reason she greeted me with a smile."
    a"Good morning Saya."
    "I try to respond naturally."
    d"Huh? Is something up?"
    a"No, ah sorry, I'm just a little tired."
    d"Ok, well make sure you leave soon, you'll be late otherwise."
    "Saya left and not long after I was ready to leave also."
    "I shut the door behind me and waited at the bottom of the stairs for Setsuko."
    "It was already late by the time I was there though, maybe she already left before me."
    "I don't think we were officially walking together yet on this day anyway."
    "So I left without her."
    "It's cloudy today, hopefully it doesn't rain."
    "I'd been walking for about fifteen minutes until I got to the main crossroad where I saw a familiar face."
    "However it wasn't Setsuko, it was Maeko."
    "In around the same place she was on Monday."
    "Although today was different, she saw me but instead of standing there awkwardly she smiled and waved."
    b"Good morning Takeru!"
    a"Hey Maeko."
    a"So, you're here again today?"
    b"What are you talking about? I told you I'd be waiting for you yesterday."
    "I familiar feeling rolls over me."
    "I don't remember her saying any such thing on the Tuesday I experienced."
    "My Tuesday and her own don't match up."
    b"You're a little late today, but that's ok. Let's get going though otherwise we'll be late."
    "We had been walking for a while but all the while Maeko had been getting closer and closer to me."
    "We were shoulder to shoulder as we walked."
    "And then"
    "She grabbed my hand."
    "And held it tight as we walked side by side."
    "My heart is pounding so loud I'm afraid Maeko might even be able to hear it."
    "Her hand is warm, especially in this cold air."
    "I don't know why she's holding my hand but I'm not apposed to the idea."
    "Especially when I don't know what's happened before today."
    "I sense my face also getting warmer, I'm blushing."
    "I try look at Maeko's face from the corner of my eye but she's looking straight ahead."
    "But her face is also bright red."
    "I've never had a girl hold my hand before, at least not since I was little."
    "How am I supposed to act?"
    "I could feel my palm becoming sweaty as her hand was entwined with mine."
    "This is so embarrassing, but I feel like this probably isn't as big of a deal as I think it is."
    "But still, no words were uttered after Maeko took my hand."
    "This isn't the time for talking."
    "I'm comfortable, and Maeko seems to be too."
    "Although I can feel the stares of the few students walking to school around us, I wonder what they're thinking."
    "They must be thinking we're a couple."
    "Oh, a couple?"
    "Is that what this truly is?"
    "I wonder how Maeko would feel if that truly were the case."
    "How would I feel?"
    "I'm not sure, but I know how I feel right now."
    "A moment like this is something I should cherish and remember, in case it never happens again."
    "Which is why it needs to be protected."

    "We approached the school gates, hands still connected."
    "We still hadn't spoken to eachother since before."
    "I feel Maeko's grip weaken as we come closer to school."
    "Although I dislike it, I feel it is necessary."
    "She lets my hand go."
    "She went ahead of me, even though we were headed to the same place."
    "Maeko turns to face me."
    b"Thanks"
    "Thanks?"
    "She ran off ahead, not allowing a single word of response from me."
    "Geez what is she doing?"
    "What am I doing?"
    "I walk behind her but she quickly disappears from view up the stairs."
    "I stand in the middle of the school courtyard while students pass me."
    "A few have seen what Maeko just did, but I'm not making it any better."
    "I feel like an idiot, I need to keep moving."
    "I step into the classroom where Maeko is sitting deligently in her seat at the front of the classroom, paying no attention to me as I walk in."
    "I drop my bag and sit down at my desk."
    "It looks like I was the last one to come into the classroom, every seat is already occupied..."
    "Except for Setsuko's."
    "Unexpectedly my mood dropped upon seeing her seat empty."
    "I didn't think I'd be like this, just seeing her away from school."
    "Maybe she's sick today?"
    "I didn't actually check if she had left this morning, I just waited for her but figured she wasn't coming."
    "I guess I'll have to eat lunch somewhere else today."
    
    with dissolve
    
    "It wasn't long until lunch started, as usual I packed my books away and walked out of the classroom."
    "I walked halfway down the hall until I felt a light hand on my shoulder."
    "I turned to see Maeko looking up at me."

    "Her cheeks changed from pale pink to crimson."
    "What does she want, maybe more hand holding or something?"
    "She stands awkwardly in the hallway playing with her hair without uttering a single word, all while facing me."
    "She's blocking people's way during the lunchtime rush, I can't have her standing here like this."
    "She's having trouble here with something, we need someplace to be alone."
    "I grab her hand, like the way she did to me this morning."
    "I turn and drag her toward the rooftop."
    "Maeko doesn't struggle, she walks with me."
    "The rooftop is empty apart from the two of us."
    "Maeko looks the same as she did in the hallway, her brown hair is blowing in the wind as she brushes it to the side."
    "Her cheeks have turned to a warm pink."
    "I walk to the iron fence overlooking the rest of the school, away from Maeko."
    "She still follows and stands beside me."
    b"Sorry!"
    "Sorry?"
    b"I'm really sorry, I don't know what I'm supposed to do when we're like this."
    a"What do you mean?"
    b"I shouldn't have said anything, I just keep ruining things..."
    a"I'm really not following you Maeko, is that about us holding hands this morning?"
    a"I don't think that was weird at all..."
    b"Really?"
    a"Yeah, well it felt good, being together like that."
    b"..."
    a"But that wasn't it was it? Tell me, what's bothering you?"
    b"Do you mind if I'm honest?"
    a"Please."
    b"I want to know what you consider our relationship as."
    "This is bad, I didn't expect a question like this."
    "I don't even know the real answer to that question in a timeline that isn't fractured."
    "But right now I don't even know what has been going on for the past week, for the past monthes, or for the past 100 years even."
    "Most of it seems the same but isn't it unusual for Maeko to come to my house so we can walk, hand in hand to school together?"
    "What IS our relationship?"
    "I flash of Setsuko's face fills my thoughts, even if it were for just a moment."
    "What is my relationship with Setsuko?"
    "I can't answer these questions honestly, the only thing I have left is answering with the best possible answer."
    "I had never really thought about Maeko as a girlfriend before, except for when we were kids."
    "But child crushes can't be considered, I only liked her for a month or two and back then I barely even knew how the procedure of a 'kiss' went."
    "But looking at her now..."
    "She's smart, attractive, we're already good friends, reliable, kind, and from the looks of things, she might like me for whatever reason."
    "Would she be happy if I said I considered her as someone I'd like to be in a relationship with?"
    "Would she be sad if I told her I considered her as a friend?"
    "There isn't much time, she's waiting for my response."

#Maeko is your girlfriend, congrats!

    a"Maeko, right now I consider us to be close childhood friends."
    a"But that doesn't mean I want it to stay that way forever."
    a"You're irreplaceable."
    a"Nobody can be, what you are, to me."
    
    "Maeko's eyes began to well up with tears."
    "Her face fell into my chest."
    "I wrap my arms around her, her soft body melts into my embrace."
    "I'm not sure what else to do, it seems this is what Maeko wants most, needs most."
    "I don't know if I'm doing the right thing."
    "But at the moment, this feels right."
    "Being this close I can smell her hair, I'd know the scent anywhere."
    "I feel raindrops, the first onset of the rain to come."
    "Quickly the rain picks up, from a slight shower to a downpour."
    "But as the rain gets worse Maeko wraps her arms tighter and tighter around me, not allowing me to escape."
    "She lifts her face, previously buried in my chest."
    "I can't tell whether she is still crying or if it's just the rain."
    b"Stay with me."
    "We're already drenched from the rain."
    "The bell rings, lunch is over."
    "Maeko whispers into my ear."
    b"We can't go back to class like this."
    "We'd probably be the only two in class to be completely soaked."
    "Maeko releases her tight grip on my body."
    "She takes my hand this time and leads me under the cover of the rooftop exit."
    "We both sit down, both cold and wet but neither of us care."
    "Maeko rests her head on my shoulder and I rest my head on hers."
    "Our body warmth is enough."
    "We sit together comfortably watching and listening to the soothing rain."
    "There's nothing more to say."
    "Right now everything is perfect."

    "We wait together while watching the rain until school ends."
    "There are still plenty of clouds looming over the school, there are no signs of the rain easing up any time soon."
    "Luckily I packed an umbrella when I saw how overcast it was this morning."
    b"Hey can we wait just a little longer..."
    b"I don't want to get caught, incase we run into a teacher for a class we should've been at."
    a"I'm sure Miss Honour Student would be able to talk us out of that sort of situation."
    "I took a step downward while saying this."
    a"They'd believe anything out of your mouth."
    b"You're very right about that, but they wouldn't believe much out of you would they?"
    "Maeko doesn't follow me down the stairs."
    a"Huh, aren't you coming?"
    b"I told you... I want to wait a while longer."
    a"What? Are you scared of having to lie to a teacher about something like this?"
    b"I'm not scared, I just don't like it ok?"
    "(So apposed to lying but still eager to manipulate my actions.)"
    "I let out a sigh."
    b"Besides, what sort of story could justify our wet clothes while both of us are out of class."
    a"Water pistol fight?"
    b"Huh?"
    a"A water park just opened next to the school?"
    b"Are you even trying?"
    a"We tripped up the stairs and couldn't unlock the door from the outside, causing us to be stranded on the rooftop until the lock rusted just enough for it to snap clean off."
    b"A little better but still stupid."
    a"I... I've got nothing left."
    a"Alright I guess I can wait a while longer if you want."
    with dissolve
    "It's been long enough, afterschool clubs have started, at worst we can pretend we're just part of the baseball team, who are actually still playing through this rain."
    
    "We manage to reach the outside of the building on the bottom floor without seeing a single teacher."
    "But the rain is still going strong."
    "I go to grab the umbrella from my bag."
    b"I forgot my umbrella."
    "I look over to the soft voice."
    "Maeko is just staring at the inside of her bag with her head hung."
    a"Don't worry about it, I'll walk you home with my umbrella."
    b"No you shouldn't do something like that."
    b"You'll be out in the rain for so long if you walk all that way."
    a"Here, come on you hold it."
    a"You've spent long enough in the rain."
    "Maeko grabs hold of the umbrella and we walk toward her house."

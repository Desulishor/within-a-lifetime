"Intro goes here"
Head collision. Screen flashes black and collision noise.
"Paper fills my vision. There's a lot of it. Floating in the air. On the floor."
"Crap, I've run into someone."
"At my feet is a girl frantically grabbing the papers that are all over the floor. She must have been in a hurry."
a"Are you all right?"
b"Yes! I'm fine!" 
"She continues to grab papers like her life dependings on it."
"Crap, this is my fault. I need to help."
"I begin grabbing papers out of the air. Judging by what's on them the order was important. I've created a lot of hassle by not looking where I was going."
"I sqaut down to hand my collected paper back to her."
"We make eye contact."
"She looks up at me with a widened gaze as he mouth opens slightly." 
b"I-Ichiro? Is that you?"
"It's the girl from earlier. *pause* And I know who she is now."
"Memories begin to flood back as I recall who it is infront of me."
"Kotaru Meiko."
"My next childhood friend for eight years."
"My fresh start looks almost impossible now."
"Damn."
"Five years of walking to school with her. She's knows almost everything about me."
"Damn."
"Same primary school, but I haven't really spoken to her since she left my middle school."
"Damn."
"I've been staring at her for a while now. I don't really know where to start."
"She grabs the papers from me and rockets upright."
"Her hands go to her hair."
"I don't have time for this right now! Aargh!"
"She turns away from me for a moment."
"When she turns back her eyes are intense."
"Takeru! It's great to see you again! We have a whole bunch of catching up to do! Take these."
"She thurst the paper's towards me. I'm not ready for this and they slam into my chest. I wrap my arms around them as she lets go, saving us from picking them up all over again."
"I need you to take these to the student council room. Right now! At once! A.S.A.P.!
"She nods to herself and bolts off."
a"Meiko! I- what?"
"She's gone."
"I don't know where to find the student council room."
"Back to square one."

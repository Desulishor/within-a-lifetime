"Within a Lifetime" Visual Novel

Synopsis:
Ichiro Takeru was a talented baseball player who was once regarded as a prodigy by everyone around him. Gifted with incredibly sharp eyesight and reflexes, he succeeds at any role within a baseball team, making him a versatile and valued player. 
Despite being as good as, if not better than the team captain however, he was always regarded as the second best player on the team. This led to many tense moments between the two, as neither wanted to be outdone and seen as weak. 
On one such occasion things spiraled out of control and led to a showdown between the two. For the first time in both their lives, they were finally going to play each other. Takeru however, due to a miscalculated pitch, caused severe injury to his opponent’s shoulder. This turned out to be permanent however, and things went downhill.
With the captains baseball career destroyed due to his actions, Takeru, now rejected by his teammates and friends, was practically forced to leave the school and quit baseball.
Leaving everything behind, he returned to the hometown he once thought boring, and enrolled in a regular school.
It isn’t long before he realises that the school wasn’t as normal and mundane as he previously thought however, as strange events began cropping up. Forced into a new, unfamiliar environment, Takeru begins his attempt to forget the past, and forge a new future.
Through his interactions with others, he soon realises that he isn’t the only one with a damaged past...

I'm just some guy trying to make a visual novel with his spare time with some help from a few friends.
This code uses the Renpy Visual Novel Engine.
If you're interested in the project, or want to help create it, feel free to ask me about it, however I'm going to keep most of this project privately run.
Thanks for stopping by.
